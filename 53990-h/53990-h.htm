    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;HIS BAPTISM OF THE SEA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his is in the
      long-ago, or, to be exact, in July, 1759. The new brig <i>Friendship</i>,
      not a fortnight off the stocks, is lying in her home harbor of Whitehaven,
      being fitted to her first suit of sails. Captain Bennison is restlessly
      about her decks, overseeing those sea-tailors, the sail-makers, as they go
      forward with their task, when Mr. Younger, the owner, comes aboard. The
      latter gentleman is lowland Scotch, stout, middle-aged, and his severe
      expanse of smooth-shaven upper-lip tells of prudence, perseverance and
      Presbyterianism in even parts, as traits dominant of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; says Mr. Younger, addressing Captain Bennison, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll have a gude
      brig; and mon! ye s&rsquo;uld have a gude crew. There&rsquo;ll be none of the last in
      Whitehaven, for what ones the agents showed me were the mere riff-raff of
      the sea. I&rsquo;ll even go to Arbigland, and pick ye a crew among the fisher
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arbigland!&rdquo; repeats Captain Bennison, with a glow of approval. &ldquo;The
      Arbigland men are the best sailor-folk that ever saw the Solway. Give me
      an Arbigland crew, James, and I&rsquo;ll find ye the Rappahannock with the <i>Friendship</i>,
      within the month after she tears her anchor out o&rsquo; Whitehaven mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Mr. Younger goes over to Arbigland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a blowing July afternoon. An off-shore breeze, now freshening to a
      gale, tosses the Solway into choppy billows. Most of the inhabitants of
      Arbigland are down at the mouth of the little tide-water creek, that forms
      the harbor of the village, eagerly watching a small fishing yawl. The
      latter craft is beating up in the teeth of the gale, striving for the
      shelter of the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew of the yawl consists of but one, and him a lad of twelve. His
      right hand holds the tiller; with the left he slacks or hauls the sheets,
      and shifts the sail when he goes about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yawl has just heeled over on the starboard tack, as Mr. Younger pushes
      in among the villagers that crowd the little quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll no make it!&rdquo; exclaims a fisherman, alluding to the boy and yawl;
      &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be blawn oot t&rsquo; sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! they&rsquo;ll make it sure enough,&rdquo; declares another stoutly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little
      Jack Paul who&rsquo;s conning her, and he&rsquo;d bring the yawl in against a
      horrycane. She&rsquo;s a gude boat, too&mdash;as quick on her feet as a dancing
      maister; and, as for beating to wind&rsquo;ard, she&rsquo;ll lay a point closer to the
      wind than a man has a right to ask of his lawful wedded wife. Ye&rsquo;ll see;
      little Jack&rsquo;ll bring her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asks Mr. Younger of the last speaker; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s yon boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s son to John Paul, gardener to the laird Craik.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitha! son to Gardener Paul, quo&rsquo; you!&rdquo; breaks in an old fish-wife who,
      with red arms folded beneath her coarse apron, stands watching the yawl
      with the others. &ldquo;Now to my mind, he looks mair like the laird than I
      s&rsquo;uld want my son to look, if I were wife to Gardener Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame for ye, Lucky!&rdquo; cries the fisherman to whom she speaks. &ldquo;Would ye
      cast doots on the lad&rsquo;s mither, and only because the lad in his favoring
      makes ye think now and again on Maister Craik? Jeanny Paul, that was
      Jeanny Macduff, is well kenned to be as carefu&rsquo; a wife as ever cooked her
      man&rsquo;s breakfast in Arbigland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye think so, Tam Bryce?&rdquo; retorts the incorrigible Lucky. &ldquo;Much ye s&rsquo;uld
      know of the wives of Arbigland, and you to sea eleven months o&rsquo; the year!
      I tell ye, Jeanny came fro&rsquo; the Highlands; and it&rsquo;ll be lang, I trow,
      since gude in shape of man or woman came oot o&rsquo; the Highlands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guide your tongue, Lucky!&rdquo; remonstrates the other, in a low tone; &ldquo;guide
      your tongue, ye jade! Here comes Gardener Paul himsel&rsquo;.&lsquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no stay to meet him,&rdquo; says Lucky, moving away. &ldquo;Puir blinded fule!
      not to see what all Arbigland, ay! and all Kirkbean Parish, too, for that
      matter, has seen the twal years, that his boy Jack is no mair no less than
      just the laird&rsquo;s bairn when all&rsquo;s said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no mind her, Maister Younger,&rdquo; says Tom Bryce, pointing after
      Lucky; &ldquo;although, to be preceese, what the carline tells has in it mair of
      truth than poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was no thinking on the dame&rsquo;s clack,&rdquo; returns Mr. Younger, his eyes
      still on the nearing yawl, &ldquo;or whether yon lad&rsquo;s a gardener&rsquo;s bairn or a
      gentleman&rsquo;s by-blaw. What I will say, in the face of the sun, however, is
      that he has in him the rudiments of as brisk a sailorman as ever walked
      saut water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be none that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; observes Tom Bryce, &ldquo;going in and oot o&rsquo;
      Solway Firth.&rdquo; Then, eyeing the yawl: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll win to the creek&rsquo;s mouth on
      the next reach to sta&rsquo;board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gardener Paul joins Mr. Younger and the fisherman, Tom Bryce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking of your son,&rdquo; says Mr. Younger to Gardener Paul. &ldquo;What
      say ye, mon; will ye apprentice him? I&rsquo;ll send him with Dick Bennison, in
      my new brig Friendship, to the Virginias and Jamaica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Paul, gardener to the laird, Robert Craik, is a dull man, notably
      thick of wit, and slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Virginias!&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;My son William has been there these sixteen
      year. He&rsquo;s head man for my kinsman Jones, on his plantation by the
      Rappahannock. If Jack sails with Dick Bennison, he&rsquo;ll meet William that
      he&rsquo;s never seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see his brother for sure,&rdquo; returns Mr. Younger. &ldquo;The <i>Friendship</i>
      goes from Whitehaven to Urbana, and that&rsquo;s not a dozen miles down the
      Rappahannock from your cousin&rsquo;s plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yawl has come safely into the creek&rsquo;s mouth, and lies rocking at her
      moorings as lightly as a gull. The lad leaps ashore, and is patted on the
      back by the fisherman in praise of his seamanship. He smiles through the
      salt water that drips from his face; for beating to windward is not the
      driest point of sailing, and the lad is spray-soaked from head to heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I go, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Younger, Jack,&rdquo; says Gardener Paul, as the lad conies up. &ldquo;He
      wants ye to sail &lsquo;prentice with Dick Bennison, in the new brig.&lsquo;&rsquo; The
      difference to show between Gardener Paul and little Jack Paul, as the pair
      stand together on the quay, goes far to justify those innuendoes of the
      scandalous Lucky. Gardener Paul&rsquo;s heavy peasant face possesses nothing to
      mark, on his part, any blood-nearness to the boy, whose olive skin, large
      brown eyes, clean profile and dark hair like silk, speak only of the
      patrician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I go, father?&rdquo; asks Jack, a flush breaking eagerly through the
      tan on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0019.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye might as weel, I think,&rdquo; responds Gardener Paul judgmatically. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re
      the born petrel; and for the matter of gardening, being my own and Adam&rsquo;s
      trade, I&rsquo;ve kenned for lang ye&rsquo;ll no mair touch spade or mattock than
      handle coals of fire. So, as I was saying, ye might as weel sail &lsquo;prentice
      with Dick; and when ye meet your brother William, gi&rsquo; him his father&rsquo;s
      gude word. Ye&rsquo;ll never have seen William, Jack, for he left hame before ye
      were born; and so it&rsquo;ll be a braw fore-gathering between the twa of ye&mdash;being
      brothers that never met before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after this fashion the fisher-boy, John Panl, afterward Admiral Paul
      Jones, is given his baptism of the sea.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;IN THE BLACK TRADE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sun is
      struggling through the dust-coated, cobwebbed windows, and lighting dimly
      yet sufficiently the dingy office of Shipowner Younger of Whitehaven. That
      substantial man is sitting at his desk, eyes fixed upon the bristle of
      upstanding masts which sprout, thick as forest pines on a hillside, from
      the harbor basin below. The face of Shipowner Younger has been given the
      seasoning of several years, since he went to Arbigland that squall-torn
      afternoon, to pick up a crew for Dick Bennison. Also, Shipowner Younger
      shines with a new expression of high yet retiring complacency. The
      expression is one awful and fascinating to the clerk, who sits at the far
      end of the room. Shipowner Younger has been elected to Parliament, and his
      awful complacency is that elevation&rsquo;s visible sign. The knowledge of his
      master&rsquo;s election offers the basis of much of the clerk&rsquo;s awe, and that
      stipendary almost charms himself into the delusion that he sees a halo
      about the bald pate of Shipowner Younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter brings the spellbound clerk from his trance of fascination, by
      wheeling upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye send doon, mon,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;to my wharf, with word for young Jack
      Paul to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk says that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye can go seek your denner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, acting on this permission, scrambles to his fascinated feet. As
      he retires through the one door, young Jack Paul enters. The brown-faced
      boy of the Arbigland yawl has grown to be a brisk young sailor, taut and
      natty. He shakes the hand of Shipowner Younger, who gives him two fingers
      in that manner of condescending reserve, which he conceives to be due his
      dignity as a member of the House of Commons. Having done so much for his
      dignity, Shipowner Younger relaxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a chair, lad!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Bring her here where we can chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The natty Jack Paul brings the clerk&rsquo;s chair, as being the only one in the
      room other than that occupied by Shipowner Younger. One sees the
      thorough-paced sailor in the very motions of him; for his step is quick,
      catlike and sure, and there is just the specter of a roll in his walk, as
      though the heaving swell of the ocean still abides in his heels. When he
      has placed the chair, so as to bring himself and Shipowner Younger face to
      face, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir, what are your commands&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have sent for ye, Jack,&rdquo; begins Shipowner Younger, portentously
      lengthening the while his shaven upper-lip&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have sent for ye,
      for three several matters: To pay ye a compliment or twa; to gi&rsquo; ye a gude
      lecture; an&rsquo; lastly to do a trifle of business wi&rsquo; ye, by way of rounding
      off. For I hold,&rdquo; goes on Shipowner Younger, in an admonishing tone, &ldquo;that
      conversations which don&rsquo;t carry a trifle of business are no mair than just
      the crackle of thorns under a pot. Ye&rsquo;ll ken I&rsquo;m rich, Jack&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll
      ken I can clink my gold, an&rsquo; count my gold, an&rsquo; keep my gold wi&rsquo; the
      warmest mon in Whitehaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Jack Paul smiles, and nods his full agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye&rsquo;ll no ken,&rdquo; goes on Shipowner Younger, with proud humility, the
      pride being real and the humility imitated&mdash;&ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll no ken, I believe,
      that I&rsquo;m &lsquo;lected to the Parleyment in Lunnon, lad?&rdquo; Shipowner Younger
      pauses to observe the effect of this announcement of his greatness. Being
      satisfied, he goes on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sacrifeece, no doot, but I s&rsquo;all make it.
      The King has need of my counsel; an&rsquo;, God save him! he s&rsquo;all have it. For
      I&rsquo;ve always said, lad, that a mon&rsquo;s first debt is to the King. But it&rsquo;ll
      mean sore changes, Jack, sore changes will it mean; for I&rsquo;m to sell up my
      ships to the last ship&rsquo;s gig of &lsquo;em, the better to leave me hand-free and
      head-free to serve the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Jack Paul is polite enough to arch his brows and draw a serious
      face. Shipowner Younger is pleased at this, and, with a deprecatory wave
      of his hand, as one who dismisses discussion of misfortunes which are
      beyond the help of words, proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But enou&rsquo; of idle clavers; I&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en get to what for I brought you here.&rdquo;
       Shipowner Younger leans far back in his big chair, and contemplates young
      Jack Paul with a twinkle. &ldquo;Now, lad,&rdquo; he begins, &ldquo;when from &lsquo;prentice ye
      are come to be first mate among my ships, I&rsquo;m to tell ye that from Dick
      Bennison who signed ye, to Ed&rsquo;ard Denbigh whose first officer ye now be,
      all the captains ye&rsquo;ve sailed wi&rsquo; declare ye a finished seaman. But&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Shipowner Younger shakes his head as though administering reproof&mdash;&ldquo;they
      add that ye be ower handy wi&rsquo; your fists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; breaks in young Jack Paul, &ldquo;how else am I to keep my watch in
      order! Besides, I hold it more humane to strike with your fist than with a
      belaying pin. The captains, I&rsquo;ll warrant, have told you I thrashed none
      but ship&rsquo;s bullies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have told me nothing of the kind,&rdquo; returns Shipowner Younger.
      &ldquo;They said naught of bullies. What they did observe was that ye just
      pounded the faces of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle hands in the strict line of duty. Why,
      they said the whole ship&rsquo;s crew loved ye like collie dogs! It seems ye&rsquo;ve
      a knack of thrashing yourself into their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Jack Paul&rsquo;s eyes show pleasure and relief; he perceives he is not
      being scolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Shipowner Younger, donning the alert manner of your
      true-born merchant approaching pounds, shillings and pence&mdash;&ldquo;and now,
      having put the compliments and the lecture astern, we&rsquo;ll even get doon to
      business. As I was tellin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m about to retire from the ships. I&rsquo;m rich
      enou&rsquo;; and, being called to gi&rsquo; counsel to the King, I want no
      exter-aneous interests to distract me. The fair truth is, I&rsquo;ve sold all
      but the bark ye&rsquo;re now wi&rsquo;, the <i>John O&rsquo; Gaunt</i>, ye&rsquo;ll ken; and
      that&rsquo;s to be sold to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sell our <i>John O&rsquo; Gaunt</i>, sir? Who is to own it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ed&rsquo;ard Denbigh, your captain, is to own five-sixths of her, for which
      he&rsquo;ll pay five thousand pounds; being dog-cheap&rdquo;&mdash;here a deep sigh&mdash;&ldquo;as
      I&rsquo;m a Christian! As for the remaining sixth, lad, why it&rsquo;s to be yours.
      Ye&rsquo;ll sail oot o&rsquo; Whitehaven this v&rsquo;yage in your own ship, partners wi&rsquo;
      Ed&rsquo;ard Denbigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; protests young Jack Paul, his voice startled into a tremor,
      &ldquo;with all thanks for your goodness, I&rsquo;ve got no thousand pounds. You know
      the wages of a mate.&lsquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! I ken the wages of a mate weel enou&rsquo;; I&rsquo;ve been payin&rsquo; &lsquo;em for thirty
      year come New Year&rsquo;s day. But ye&rsquo;ll no need money, Jack!&rdquo;&mdash;the dry,
      harsh tones grow soft with kindliness&mdash;&ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll no need money, mon, and
      there&rsquo;s the joke of it. For I&rsquo;m to gi&rsquo; ye your one-sixth of the John O&rsquo;
      Gaunt, wi&rsquo; never a shillin&rsquo; from your fingers, and so make a man and a
      merchant of ye at a crack. Now, no words, lad! Ye&rsquo;ve been faithful; and
      I&rsquo;ve no&rsquo; forgot that off Cape Clear one day ye saved me a ship. Ay! ye&rsquo;ll
      ken by now that Jamie Younger, for all he&rsquo;s &lsquo;lected to Parleyment to tell
      the King his mind, is no so giddy wi&rsquo; his honors as to forget folk who
      serve him. No words, I tell ye! There ye be, sailor and shipowner baith,
      before ye&rsquo;re twenty-one. An&rsquo; gude go wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big-hearted Scotchman smothers the gratitude on the lips of young Jack
      Paul, and hands him out the door. As the latter goes down the stair,
      Shipowner Younger calls after him with a kind of anticipatory crow of
      exultation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, lad! if ye get ever to Lunnon, come doon to Westminster, and see me
      just passin&rsquo; the laws!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>John O&rsquo; Gaunt</i> lies off the Guinea coast. The last one of its
      moaning, groaning, black cargo of slaves has come over the side from the
      shore boats, and been conveyed below. The <i>John O&rsquo; Gaunt</i> has been
      chartered by a Bristol firm to carry three thousand slaves from the
      Guineas to Kingston; it will require ten voyages, and this is the
      beginning of the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three hundred unhappy blacks who make the cargo are between decks.
      There they squat in four ranks, held by light wrist-chains to two great
      iron cables which are stretched forward and aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four squatting ranks of them; each rank sits face to face with
      its fellow rank across the detaining cable. Thus will they sit and suffer,
      cramped and choked and half-starved in that tropical hell between decks,
      through those two-score days and nights which lie between the <i>John O&rsquo;
      Gaunt</i> and Kingston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Denbigh keeps the deck until the anchors are up. The wind is
      forward of the beam, and now, when its canvas is shaken out, the <i>John
      O&rsquo; Gaunt</i> begins to move through the water on the starboard tack. The
      motion is slow and sulky, as though the ship were sick in its heart at the
      vile traffic it has come to, and must be goaded by stiffest gales before
      it consents to any show of speed. Captain Denbigh leaves the order, &ldquo;West
      by north!&rdquo; with second mate Boggs, who has the watch on deck; and, after
      glancing aloft at the sails and over the rail at the weather, waddles
      below to drink &ldquo;Prosperous voyage!&rdquo; with his first mate and fellow owner,
      young Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finds that youthful mariner gloomy and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin where the two are berthed is roomy. At one end is a case of
      bottles&mdash;brandy and rum, the property of Captain Denbigh. At the
      other is a second lock-fast case, filled with books, the sailing
      companions of first mate Jack Paul. There are text-books&mdash;French,
      Spanish, Latin and Greek; for first mate Jack Paul is of a mind to learn
      languages during his watch below. There are books on navigation and
      astronomy, as well as volumes by De Foe and Richardson. Also, one sees the
      comedies of Congreve, and the poems of Alexander Pope. To these latter,
      first mate Jack Paul gives much attention; his inquiring nose is often
      between their covers. He studies English elegancies of speech and manner
      in Congreve, Pope and Richardson, while the crop-eared De Foe feeds his
      fancy for adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Captain Denbigh rolls into the cabin, first mate Jack Paul is not
      thinking on books. He has upon his mind the poor black wretches between
      decks, the muffled murmur of whose groans, together with the clanking of
      their wrist-chains, penetrates the bulkhead which forms the forward cabin
      wall. Captain Denbigh never heeds the silence and the sadness of his
      junior officer and partner, but marches, feet spread wide and sailorwise,
      to the locker which holds his bottles. Making careful selection, he brings
      out one of rum and another of sherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You not likin&rsquo; rum,&rdquo; explains Captain Denbigh, as he sets the sherry
      within reach of first mate Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul mechanically fills himself a moderate glass, while
      Captain Denbigh does himself more generous credit with a brimmer from the
      rum bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the good ship <i>John O&rsquo; Gaunt</i>,&rdquo; cries Captain Denbigh,
      tossing the rum down his capacious throat. &ldquo;May it live to carry niggers a
      hundred years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is no response to this sentiment; but Captain Denbigh doesn&rsquo;t feel
      at all slighted, and sits down comfortably to the floor-fast table, the
      rum at his elbow. Being thus disposed, he glances at his moody companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much that is handsome in a rough, saltwater way about Captain
      Denbigh. He is short, stout, with a brown pillar of a throat, and
      shoulders as square as his yardarms. His thick hair is clubbed into a cue;
      there are gold rings in his ears, and his gray eyes laugh as he looks at
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; now, mate Jack,&rdquo; says Captain Denbigh, cheerfully, &ldquo;with our three
      hundred niggers stowed snug, an&rsquo; we out&rsquo;ard bound for Jamaica, let you an&rsquo;
      me have a bit of talk. Not as cap &lsquo;in an&rsquo; mate, mind you, but as owners.
      To begin with, then, you don&rsquo;t like the black trade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul looks up; the brown eyes show trouble and resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it goes against my soul!&rdquo; Then, he continues
      apologetically: &ldquo;Not that I say aught against slavery, which I&rsquo;ve heard
      chaplains and parsons prove to be right and pious by Bible text. Ay! I&rsquo;ve
      heard them when I&rsquo;ve been to church ashore, with my brother William by the
      Rappahannock. My kinsman Jones owns slaves; and I can see, too, that they
      have safer, happier lives with him than could fall to their lot had they
      remained savages in the wild Guinea woods. But owning slaves by the
      Rappahannock, where you can give them kindness and make them happy, is one
      thing. This carrying the tortured creatures &mdash;chained, and mad with
      grief!&mdash;to Jamaica is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Denbigh refreshes himself with more rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wards off the heat,&rdquo; he vouchsafes, in extenuation of his partiality
      for the rum. Having set himself right touching rum, he takes, up the main
      question: &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re chartered for ten
      v&rsquo;yages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no one to argue with my captain,&rdquo; responds first mate Jack Paul.
      &ldquo;Still less do I talk of breaking charters. All I say is, it makes me
      heart-sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; responds Captain Denbigh, searching for an idea. &ldquo;Your
      brother William tells me, the last time we takes in tobacco from the Jones
      plantation, that old William Jones is as fond o&rsquo; you as o&rsquo; him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. He wanted me to stay ashore with him and William, and give
      up the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; why not, mate Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul shrugs his shoulders, which, despite his youth, are
      as broad and square as his captain&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I like the sea,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and shall always like the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Denbigh takes more rum; after which he sits knitting his forehead
      into knots, in a very agony of cogitation. Finally he gives the table a
      great bang, at which the rum bottle jumps in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;I knowed I would if I&rsquo;d only drink rum enough. I
      never has a bright idea yet, I don&rsquo;t get it from rum. Here, now, mate
      Jack; I&rsquo;ll just buy you out. You don&rsquo;t like the black trade, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
      like it less an&rsquo; less. It&rsquo;s your readin&rsquo; books does it; that, an not
      drinkin rum. Howsumever, I&rsquo;ll buy you out. Then you can take a
      merchant-ship; or&mdash;an&rsquo; you may call me no seaman if that ain&rsquo;t what
      I&rsquo;d do you sits down comfortable with your brother an&rsquo; your old kinsman
      Jones by the Rappahannock, an plays gentleman ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Captain Denbigh talks, the trouble fades from the face of first mate
      Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll buy me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lad! as sure as my name&rsquo;s Ed&rsquo;ard Denbigh. That is, if so be you can
      sell, bein&rsquo; under age. I allows you can, howsumever; for you&rsquo;re no one to
      go back on a bargain.&rdquo; Having thus adjusted to his liking the legal doubt
      suggested, Captain Denbigh turns to the question of price. &ldquo;Master Younger
      puts your sixth at a thousand pounds. If so be you&rsquo;ll say the word, mate
      Jack, I&rsquo;ll give you a thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Countenance brightened with a vast relief, first mate Jack Paul stretches
      his hand across the table. Captain Denbigh, shifting his glass to the left
      hand, grasps it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; says first mate Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; done to you, my hearty!&rdquo; exclaims Captain Denbigh. &ldquo;The money&rsquo;ll be
      yours, mate Jack, as soon as ever we sees Kingston light. An&rsquo; now for
      another hooker of rum to bind the bargain.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE YELLOW JACK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t Kingston,
      Captain Denbigh goes ashore with first mate Jack Paul, and pays over in
      Bank of England paper those one thousand pounds which represent that
      one-sixth interest in the <i>John O&rsquo;Gaunt</i>. While the pair are upon
      this bit of maritime business, the three hundred mournful blacks are
      landed under the supervision of the second mate. Among the virtues which a
      cargo of slaves possesses over a shipment of cotton or sugar or rum, is
      the virtue of legs. This merit is made so much of by the energetic second
      officer of the <i>John O&rsquo;Gaunt</i>, that, within half a day, the last of
      the three hundred blacks is landed on the Kingston quay. Received and
      receipted for by a bilious Spaniard with an umbrella hat, who is their
      consignee, the blacks are marched away to the stockade which will confine
      them while awaiting distribution among the plantations. Captain Denbigh
      puts to sea with the <i>John O&rsquo;Gaunt</i> in ballast the same evening. A
      brisk seaman, and brisker man of business, is Captain Denbigh, and no one
      to spend money and time ashore, when he may be making the one and saving
      the other afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul, his fortune of one thousand pounds safe in the
      strong-boxes of the Kingston bank, sallies forth to look for a ship. He
      decides to go passenger, for the sake of seeing what it is like, and his
      first thought is to visit his brother William by the Rappahannock. This
      fraternal venture he forbears, when he discovers Kingston to be in the
      clutch of that saffron terror the yellow fever. Little is being locally
      said of the epidemic, for the town is fearful of frightening away its
      commerce. The Kingston heart, like most human hearts, thinks more of its
      own gold than of the lives of other men. Wherefore Kingston is sedulous to
      hide the plague in its midst, lest word go abroad on blue water and drive
      away the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul becomes aware of Kingston for the death-trap it is
      before he is ashore two days. It is the suspicious multitude of funerals
      thronging the sun-baked streets, that gives him word. And yet the grewsome
      situation owns no peculiar threat for him, since he has sailed these
      blistering latitudes so often and so much that he may call himself immune.
      For him, the disastrous side is that, despite the Kingston efforts at
      concealment, a plague-whisper drifted out to sea, and as a cautious
      consequence the Kingston shipping has dwindled to be nothing. This
      scarcity of ships vastly interferes with that chance of a passage home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first craft, outward bound for England, shall do,&rdquo; thinks first mate
      Jack Paul. &ldquo;As to William, I&rsquo;ll defer my visit until I may go ashore to
      him without bringing the yellow jack upon half Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While waiting for that home-bound ship, first mate Jack Paul goes upon a
      pilgrimage of respect to the tomb of Admiral Benbow. That sea-wolf lies
      buried in the parish chapel-yard in King Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As first mate Jack Paul leaves the little burying-ground, he runs foul of
      a polite adventure which, in its final expression, will have effect upon
      his destiny. His aid is enlisted in favor of a lady in trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troubled lady, fat, florid and forty, is being conveyed along King
      Street in her <i>ketureen</i>, a sort of sedan chair on two wheels, drawn
      by a half-broken English horse. The horse, excited by a funeral procession
      of dancing, singing, shouting blacks, capsizes the <i>ketureen</i>, and
      the fat, florid one is decanted upon the curb at the feet of first mate
      Jack Paul. Alive to what is Christian in the way of duty, he raises the
      florid, fat decanted one, and congratulates her upon having suffered no
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>ketureen</i> is restored to an even keel. The fat, florid one
      boards it, though not before she invites first mate Jack Paul to dinner.
      Being idle, lonesome, and hungry for English dishes, he accepts, and
      accompanies the fat, florid one in the dual guise of guest and bodyguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Holman Hardy, husband to the fat, florid one, is as fatly florid as
      his spouse. Incidentally he is in command of what British soldiers are
      stationed at Kingston. The fat, florid one presents first mate Jack Paul
      to her Hector, tells the tale of the rescue, and thereupon the three go in
      to dinner. Later, first mate Jack Paul and his host smoke in the deep
      veranda, where, during the cool of the evening, Sir Holman drinks
      sangaree, and first mate Jack Paul drinks Madeira. Also Sir Holman
      inveighs against the Horse Guards for consigning him to such a pit of
      Tophet as is Kingston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between sangaree and maledictions levelled at the Horse Guards, Sir Holman
      gives first mate Jack Paul word of a brig, the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i>,
      out of China for Kingston with tea, which he looks for every day.
      Discharging its tea, the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i> will load with rum
      for Whitehaven; and Sir Holman declares that first mate Jack Paul shall
      sail therein, a passenger-guest, for home. Sir Holman is able to promise
      this, since the fat, florid rescued one is the child of Shipowner Donald
      of Donald, Currie &amp; Beck, owners of the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which makes me,&rdquo; expounds Sir Holman, his nose in the sangaree, &ldquo;a kind
      of son-in-law to the brig itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grumblingly intimates&mdash;he is far gone in sangaree at the time&mdash;that
      a fleet of just such sea-trinkets as the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i>, so
      far as he has experimented with the marital condition, constitutes the one
      redeeming feature of wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; concludes the excellent Sir Holman, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re to go home with the
      rum, guest of the ship itself; and the thing I could weep over is that I
      cannot send my kit aboard and sail with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days go by, and the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i> is sighted off Port
      Royal; twenty-four hours later its master, Captain Macadam&mdash;-a Solway
      man&mdash;is drinking Sir Holman&rsquo;s sangaree. Making good his word, Sir
      Holman sends for first mate Jack Paul, and that business of going
      passenger to Whitehaven is adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; observes Captain Macadam, when he understands&mdash;&ldquo;true, the <i>George</i>
      isn&rsquo;t fitted up for passengers. But&rdquo;&mdash;turning to first mate Jack Paul&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
      no mind; bein&rsquo; a seaman yours eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that, Captain,&rdquo; breaks in Sir Holman, &ldquo;since the port is
      reeling full of yellow jack, some of your people might take it to sea with
      them. Should aught go wrong, now, why here is your passenger, a finished
      sailorman, to give you a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Macadam&rsquo;s face has been tanned like leather. None the less, as he
      hears the above the mahogany hue thereof lapses into a pasty, piecrust
      color. Plainly that word yellow jack fills his soul with fear. He mentions
      the wearisome fact to first mate Jack Paul, as he and that young
      gentleman, after their cigars and sangaree with Sir Holman, are making a
      midnight wake for the change house whereat they have bespoken beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no kindly,&rdquo; complains Captain Macadam, &ldquo;for Sir Holman to let me run
      my brig blindfold into sic a snare. But then he has a fourth share in the
      tea, and another in the rum; and so, for his profit like, he lets me tak&rsquo;
      my chances. He&rsquo;d stude better wi&rsquo; God on high I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, if he&rsquo;d let
      his profit gone by, and just had a pilot boat standin&rsquo; off and on at Port
      Royal, to gi&rsquo; me the wink to go wide. I could ha&rsquo; taken the tea to New
      York weel enou&rsquo;. But bein&rsquo; I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; concludes the disturbed Captain,
      appealing to first mate Jack Paul, &ldquo;what would ye advise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get your tea ashore and your rum aboard as fast as you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! that&rsquo;ll about be the weesdom of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Macadam can talk of nothing but yellow jack all the way to the
      change house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I was ever in these watters,&rdquo; he explains
      apologetically, &ldquo;and now I can smell fever in the air! Ay! the hond o&rsquo;
      death is on these islands! Be ye no afeard, mon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul says that he is not. Also he is a trifle irritated at
      the alarm of the timorous Captain Macadam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll just be your youth now!&rdquo; observes the timorous one. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no old
      enou&rsquo; to grasp the responsibeelities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At four in the morning Captain Macadam comes into first mate Jack Paul&rsquo;s
      room at the change house. He is clad in his linen sleeping suit, and his
      teeth are chattering a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bein&rsquo; ashore makes my teeth drum,&rdquo; he vouchsafes. &ldquo;But what I
      wushed to ask ye, lad, is d&rsquo;ye believe in fortunes? No? Weel, then,
      neither do I; only I remembered like that lang syne a wierd warlock sort
      o&rsquo; body tells me in the port o&rsquo; Leith, that I&rsquo;m to meet my death in the
      West Injies. It&rsquo;s the first time, as I was tellin&rsquo; ye, that ever I comes
      pokin&rsquo; my snout amang these islands; and losh! I believe that warlock
      chiel was right. I&rsquo;ve come for my death sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Macadam promises his crew&rsquo; double grog and double wages, and works
      night and day lightering his tea ashore, and getting his rum casks into
      the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i>. Then he calls a pilot, and, with a
      four-knot breeze behind him, worms his way along the narrow, corkscrew
      channel, until he finds himself in open water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pilot goes over the side, and Captain Macadam takes the brig. He
      casts an anxious eye astern at Port Royal, four miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no feel safe,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;while yon Satan&rsquo;s nest is under my quarter.
      And afterward I&rsquo;ll no feel safe neither. How many days, mon, is a victeem
      to stand by and look for symptoms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul, to whom the query is put, gives it as his opinion
      that, if they have yellow fever aboard, it will make its appearance within
      the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel that&rsquo;s a mercy ony way!&rdquo; says Captain Macadam with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, besides first mate Jack Paul, and the Captain with his two
      officers, twelve seamen and the cook&mdash;seventeen souls in all&mdash;aboard
      the <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i> as, north by east, it crawls away from
      Port Royal. For four days the winds hold light but fair. Then come head
      winds, and the brig finds itself making long tacks to and fro in the
      Windward Passage, somewhere between Cape Mazie and the Mole St. Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see, mon!&rdquo; cries Captain Macadam, whose fears have increased, not
      diminished, since he last saw the Jamaica lights. &ldquo;The vera weather seeks
      to keep us in this trap! I&rsquo;ll no be feelin&rsquo; ower weel neither, let me tell
      ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul informs the alarmed Captain that to fear the fever is
      to invite it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no afeard, mon,&rdquo; returns Captain Macadam, with a groan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
      impressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The timidities of the Captain creep among the mates and crew; forward and
      aft the feeling is one of terror. The <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i> becomes
      a vessel of gloom. There are no songs, no whistling for a wind. Even the
      cook&rsquo;s fiddle is silent, and the galley grows as melancholy as the
      forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is eight bells in the afternoon of the fourth day, when the man at the
      wheel calls to Captain Macadam. He tosses his thumb astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Macadam peers over the rail, and counts eleven huge sharks. The
      monsters are following the brig. Also, they seem in an ugly mood, since
      ever and anon they dash at one another ferociously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a sign!&rdquo; whispers Captain Macadam. Then he counts them.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;leven o&rsquo; them,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and that means we&rsquo;re &lsquo;leven to
      die!&rdquo; After this he dives below, and takes to the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bleared of eye, shaken of hand, Captain Macadam on the fifth morning finds
      first mate Jack Paul on the after deck. The eleven sharks are still
      sculling sullenly along in the slow wake of the wind-bound brig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be they there yet?&rdquo; asks Captain Macadam, looking over the stern with a
      ghastly grin. Then answering his own query: &ldquo;Ay! they&rsquo;ll be there&mdash;the
      &lsquo;leven of &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul, observing their daunting effect on the over-harrowed
      nerves of Captain Macadam, is for having up his pistols to take a shot at
      the sharks; but he is stayed by the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be sent,&rdquo; says Captain Macadam; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll no do to slay &lsquo;em, mon!
      But losh! ain&rsquo;t a sherk a fearfu&rsquo; feesli?&rdquo; Then, seeing his hand shake on
      the brig&rsquo;s rail: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rum. And that&rsquo;s no gude omen, me takin&rsquo; to the
      rum; for I&rsquo;m not preeceesely what you&rsquo;d ca&rsquo; a drinkin&rsquo; body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later Captain Macadam issues from his cabin and seeks first mate
      Jack Paul, where the latter is sitting in the shade of the main sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon, look at me!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye no see? I tell ye, Death has found me
      oot on the deep watters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The single glance assures first mate Jack Paul that Captain Macadam is
      right. His eyes are congested and ferrety; his face is flushed. Even while
      first mate Jack Paul looks, he sees the skin turn yellow as a lemon. He
      thumbs the sick man&rsquo;s wrist; the pulse is thumping like a trip-hammer.
      Also, the dry, fevered skin shows an abnormal temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tongue!&rdquo; says first mate Jack Paul; for he has a working knowledge
      of yellow jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but piling evidence upon evidence; the tongue is the color of liver.
      Three hours later, the doomed man is delirious. Then the fever gives way
      to a chill; presently he goes raving his way into eternity, and the <i>King
      George&rsquo;s Packet</i> loses its Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul sews the dead skipper in a hammock with his own
      fingers; since, mates, crew and cook, not another will bear a hand. When
      the hammock sewing is over, the cook aids in bringing the corpse on deck.
      As the body slips from the grating into the sea, a thirty-two pound shot
      at the heels, the cook laughs overboard at the sharks, still hanging, like
      hounds upon a scent, to the brig&rsquo;s wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to dive for the skipper, lads!&rdquo; sings out the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offended by this ribaldry, first mate Jack Paul is on the brink of
      striking the cook down with a belaying pin. For his own nerves are
      a-jangle, and that misplaced merriment rasps. It is the look in the man&rsquo;s
      face which stays his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be right!&rdquo; cries the cook, as though replying to something in the
      eye of first mate Jack Paul. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it? It is I who&rsquo;ll follow the
      skipper! I&rsquo;ll just go sew my own hammock, and have it ready, shot and
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the cook starts for the galley, a maniac yell is heard from the
      forecastle. At that, he pauses, sloping his ear to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have company,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      First the cook; then the mates; then seven of the crew. One after the
      other, they follow a thirty-two pound shot over the side; for after the
      Captain&rsquo;s death the sailors lose their horror of the plague-killed ones,
      and sew them up and slip them into the sea as readily as though they are
      bags of bran. The worst is that a fashion of dull panic takes them, and
      they refuse their duty. There is no one to command, they say; and, since
      there can be no commands, there can be no duty. With that they hang
      moodily about the capstan, or sulk in their bunks below.
    </p>
    <p>
      First mate Jack Paul takes the wheel, rather than leave the <i>King
      George&rsquo;s Packet</i> to con itself across the ocean. As he is standing at
      the wheel trying to make a plan to save the brig and himself, he observes
      a sailor blundering aft. The man dives below, and the next moment, through
      the open skylights, first mate Jack Paul hears him rummaging the Captain&rsquo;s
      cabin. In a trice, he lashes the wheel, and slips below on the heels of
      the sailor. As he surmises, the man is at the rum. Without word spoken, he
      knocks the would-be rum guzzler over, and then kicks him up the companion
      way to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing only to stick a couple of pistols in his belt, first mate Jack
      Paul follows that kicked seaman with a taste for rum. He walks first to
      the wheel. The wind is steady and light; for the moment the brig will mind
      itself. Through some impulse he glances over the stern; the sharks are
      gone. This gives him a thought; he will use the going of the sharks to
      coax the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five are grouped about the capstan, the one who was struck is bleeding
      like tragedy. First mate Jack Paul makes them a little speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no more to die,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;The called-for eleven are dead, and
      the sharks no longer follow us. That shows the ship free of menace; we&rsquo;re
      all to see England again. And now, mates&rdquo;&mdash;there is that in the tone
      which makes the five look up&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bit of news. From now, until
      its anchors are down in Whitehaven basin, I shall command this ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; speaks up a big sailor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no but a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m man enough to sail the brig to England, and make you work like a dog,
      you swab!&rdquo; The look in the eye of first mate Jack Paul, makes the capstan
      quintette uneasy. He goes on: &ldquo;Come, my hearties, which shall it be?
      Sudden death? or you to do your duty by brig and owners? For, as sure as
      ever I saw the Solway, the first who doesn&rsquo;t jump to my order, I&rsquo;ll plant
      a brace of bullets in his belly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so rebellion ceases; the five come off their gloomings and their
      grumblings, and spring to their work of sailing the brig. It is labor
      night and day, however, for all aboard; but the winds blow the fever away,
      the gales favor them, one and all they seem to have worn out the evil
      fortune which dogged them out of Kingston. The <i>King George&rsquo;s Packet</i>
      comes safe, at the last of it, into Whitehaven&mdash;-first mate Jack Paul
      and his crew of five looking for the lack of sleep like dead folk walking
      the decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donald, Currie &amp; Beck pay a grateful salvage on brig and cargo to
      first mate Jack Paul and the five, for bringing home the brig. This puts
      six hundred pounds into the pockets of first mate Jack Paul, and one-fifth
      as much into the pockets of each of the five. Then Donald, Currie &amp;
      Beck have first mate Jack Paul to dinner with the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a ship for ye,&rdquo; says shipowner Donald, as the wine is being
      passed. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re to be Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; repeats first mate Jack Paul. &ldquo;A ship for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else, then!&rdquo; returns shipowner Donald. &ldquo;Ay! it&rsquo;s the <i>Crantully
      Castle</i>, four hundred tons, out o&rsquo; Plymouth for Bombay. Ye&rsquo;re to be
      Captain; besides, ye&rsquo;re to have a tenth in the cargo. And now if that
      suits ye, gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;addressing shipowners Currie &amp; Beck&mdash;&ldquo;let
      the firm of Donald, Currie &amp; Beck fill up the glasses to the <i>Crantully
      Castle</i> and its new Captain, Jack Paul.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE KILLING OF MUNGO
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>aptain Jack Paul
      and his <i>Grantully Castle</i> see friendly years together. They go to
      India, to Spain, to the West Indies, to the Mediterranean, to Africa.
      While Captain Jack Paul is busy with the <i>Grantully Castle</i>, piling
      up pounds and shillings and pence for owners Donald, Currie &amp; Beck, he
      is also deep with the books, hammering at French, Spanish and German.
      Ashore, he makes his way into what best society he can find, being as
      eager to refine his manners as refine his mind, holding the one as much an
      education as is the other. Finally he is known in every ocean for the
      profundity of his learning, the polish of his deportment, the power of his
      fists, and the powder-like explosiveness of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a cloudy October afternoon when Captain Jack Paul works the <i>Grantully
      Castle</i> out of Plymouth, shakes free his canvas, and fills away on the
      starboard tack for Tobago. The crew is an evil lot, and a spirit of mutiny
      stirs in the ship. Captain Jack Paul, who holds that a good sailor is ever
      a good grumbler, can overlook a deal in favor of this aphorism; and does.
      On the sixth day out, however, when his first officer, Mr. Sands, staggers
      below with a sheath-knife through his shoulder, it makes a case to which
      no commander can afford to seem blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mungo!&rdquo; explains the wounded Mr. Sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jack Paul goes on deck, and takes his stand by the main mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pipe all hands aft, Mr. Cooper,&rdquo; he says to the boatswain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew straggle aft. They offer a circling score of brutal faces; in
      each the dominant expression is defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man Mungo!&rdquo; says Captain Jack Paul. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word, a gigantic black slouches out from among his mates. Sloping
      shoulders, barrel body, long, swinging arms like a gorilla&rsquo;s, bandy legs,
      huge hands and feet, head the size and shape of a cocoanut, small, black
      serpent eyes, no soul unless a fiend&rsquo;s soul, Mungo is at once tyrant,
      pride and leader of the forecastle. Rumor declares that he has sailed
      pirate in his time, and should be sun-drying in chains on the gibbet at
      Corso Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stands before Captain Jack Paul, Mungo&rsquo;s features are in a black
      snarl of fury. It is in his heart to do murderously more for his captain
      than he did for first officer Sands. He waits only the occasion before
      making a spring. Captain Jack Paul looks him over with a grim stare as he
      slouches before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cooper,&rdquo; says Captain Jack Paul after a moment, during which he reads
      the black Mungo like a page of print, &ldquo;fetch the irons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boatswain is back on deck with a pair of steel wristlets in briefest
      space. He passes them to Captain Jack Paul. At this, Mungo glowers, while
      the mutinous faces in the background put on a dull sullenness. There are a
      brace of pistols in the belt of Captain Jack Paul, of which the sullen
      dull ones do not like the look. Mungo, a black berserk, cares little for
      the pistols, seeing he is in a white-hot rage, the hotter for being held
      in present check. Captain Jack Paul, on his part, is in no wise asleep; he
      notes the rolling, roving, bloodshot eye, like the eye of a wild beast at
      bay, and is prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold out your hands!&rdquo; comes the curt command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly it is the signal for which Mungo waited. With a growling roar,
      bear-like in its guttural ferocity, he rushes upon Captain Jack Paul. The
      roaring rush is of the suddenest, but the latter is on the alert. Quick as
      is Mungo, Captain Jack Paul is quicker. Seizing a belaying-pin, he brings
      it crashing down on the skull of the roaring, charging black. The heavy,
      clublike pin is splintered; Mungo drops to the deck, a shivering heap. The
      great hands close and open; the muscles clutch and knot under the black
      skin; there is a choking gurgle. Then the mighty limbs relax; the face
      tarns from black to a sickly tallow. Mouth agape, eyes wide and staring,
      Mungo lies still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jack Paul surveys the prostrate black. Then he tosses the irons to
      Boatswain Cooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not be needed, Mr. Bo&rsquo;sen,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Pipe the crew for&rsquo;ard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keen whistle sings; the mutinous ones scuttle forward, like fowls that
      hear the high scream of some menacing hawk..
    </p>
    <p>
      It is two bells in the evening; the port watch, in charge of the
      knife-wounded Mr. Sands, has the deck. The dead Mungo, tight-clouted in a
      hammock, lies stretched on a grating, ready for burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jack Paul comes up from his cabin. In his hand he carries a
      prayer-book. Also those two pistols are still in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out the watch below!&rdquo; is the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew makes a silent half-circle about the dead Mungo. That mutinous
      sullenness, recently the defiant expression of their faces, is supplanted
      by a deprecatory look, composite of apology and fear. It is as though they
      would convince Captain Jack Paul of their tame and sheep-like frame of
      thought. The fate of Mungo has instructed them; for one and all they are
      of that criminal, coward brood, best convinced by a club and with whom
      death is the only conclusive argument. As they stand uncovered about the
      rigid one in the clouted hammock, they realize in full the villainy of
      mutiny, and abandon that ship-rebellion which has been forecastle talk and
      plan since ever the Plymouth lights went out astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jack Paul reads a prayer, and the dead Mungo is surrendered to the
      deep. As the body goes splashing into the sea, Captain Jack Paul turns on
      the subdued ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you this, my men!&rdquo; says he. His tones have a cold,
      threatening ring, like the clink of iron on arctic ice. &ldquo;The first of you
      who so much as lifts an eyebrow in refusal of an order shall go the same
      voyage as the black. And so I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jack Paul brings the <i>Grantully Castle</i> into Tobago, crew as
      it might be a crew of lambs. Once his anchors are down, he signals for the
      port admiral. Within half an hour the gig of that dignitary is alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Simpson, Judge Surrogate of the Vice-Admiralty Court of
      Tobago, with the Honorable Young, Lieutenant-Governor of the colony, to
      give him countenance, opens court in the after cabins of the <i>Grantully
      Castle</i>. The crew are examined, man after man. They say little, lest
      they themselves be caught in some law net, and landed high and dry in the
      Tobago jail. First Officer Sands shows his wound and tells his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the inquiry Captain Jack Paul sits in silence, listening and
      looking on. He puts no questions to either mate or crew. When First
      Officer Sands is finished, the Honorable Simpson asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, in the killing of the black, Mungo, are you in conscience
      convinced that you used no more force than was necessary to preserve
      discipline in your ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please,&rdquo; returns Captain Jack Paul, who has not been at his books
      these years for nothing, and is fit to cope with a king&rsquo;s counsel &mdash;&ldquo;may
      it please, I would say that it was necessary in the course of duty to
      strike the mutineer Mungo. This was on the high seas. Whenever it becomes
      necessary for a commanding officer to strike a seaman, it is necessary to
      strike with a weapon. Also, the necessity to strike carries with it the
      necessity to kill or disable the mutineer. I call your attention to the
      fact that I had loaded pistols in my belt, and could have shot the
      mutineer Mungo. I struck with a belaying-pin in preference, because I
      hoped that I might subdue him without killing him. The result proved
      otherwise. I trust your Honorable Court will take due account that,
      although armed with pistols throwing ounce balls, weapons surely fatal in
      my hands, I used a belaying-pin, which, though a dangerous, is not
      necessarily a fatal weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this statement, the Honorable Simpson and the Honorable Young confer.
      As the upcome of their conference, the Honorable Simpson announces
      judgment, exonerating Captain Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sailor Mungo, being at the time on the high seas, was in a state of
      mutiny.&rdquo; Thus runs the finding as set forth in the records of the
      Vice-Admiralty Court of Tobago. &ldquo;The sailor Mungo was mutinous under
      circumstances which lodged plenary power in the hands of the master of the
      vessel. Therefore, the homicide was justifiable, because it had become the
      only means of maintaining the discipline required for the safety of the
      ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court rises, and Captain Jack Paul bows the Honorable Simpson and the
      Honorable Young over the side. When they are clear, First Officer Sands
      addresses Captain Jack Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the crew to be set ashore, sir?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Mr. Sands, would you discharge the best crew we&rsquo;ve ever had?&rdquo; He
      continues as though replying to his first officer&rsquo;s look of astonishment.
      &ldquo;I grant you they were a trifle uncurried at first. The error of their
      ways, however, broke upon them with all clearness in the going of Mungo.
      As matters now are, compared to the <i>Grantully Castle</i>, a dove-cote
      is a merest theatre of violence and murderous blood. No, Mr. Sands; we
      will keep our crew if you please. Should there be further mutiny, why then
      there shall be further belaying-pins, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Grantully Castle</i> goes finally back to England, the most
      peaceful creature of oak and cordage that ever breasted the Atlantic.
      Cargo discharged, the ship is sent into winter overhaul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, sir,&rdquo; remarks owner Donald, of Donald, Currie &amp; Beck,
      shoving the wine across to Captain Jack Paul, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re just a maister
      mariner of gold! Ye&rsquo;ll no wait ashore for the <i>Grantully Castle</i>.
      We&rsquo;ve been buildin&rsquo; ye a new ship at our Portsmouth yards. She&rsquo;s off the
      ways a month, and s&rsquo;uld be sparred and rigged and ready for the waves by
      now. We&rsquo;ve called her <i>The Two Friends</i>.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE SAILOR TURNS PLANTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he wooded April
      banks of the Rappahannock are flourishing in the new green of an early
      Virginia spring. The bark <i>Two Friends</i>, Captain Jack Paul, out of
      Whitehaven by way of Lisbon, Madeira, and Kingston, comes picking her dull
      way up the river, and anchors midstream at the foot of the William Jones
      plantation. Almost coincident with the splash of the anchors, the <i>Two
      Friends</i> has her gig in the water, and the next moment Captain Jack
      Paul takes his place in the stern sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let fall!&rdquo; comes the sharp command, as he seizes the tiller-ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four sailors bend their strong backs, the four oars swing together
      like clockwork, and the gig heads for the plantation landing where a
      twenty-ton sloop, current-vexed, lies gnawing at her ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty-six, Captain Jack Paul is the very flower of a quarter-deck
      nobility. He has not the advantage of commanding height; but the lean,
      curved nose, clean jaw, firmly-lined month, steady stare of the brown
      eyes, coupled at the earliest smell of opposition with a frowning falcon
      trick of brow like a threat, are as a commission to him, signed and
      countersigned by nature, to be ever a leader of men. In figure he is five
      feet seven inches, and the scales telling his weight consent to one
      hundred and forty-five pounds. His hands and feet are as small as a
      woman&rsquo;s. By way of offset to this, his shoulders, broad and heavy, and his
      deep chest arched like the deck of a whale-back, speak of anything save
      the effeminate. In his movements there is a feline graceful accuracy> with
      over all a resolute atmosphere of enterprise. To his men, he is more than
      a captain; he is a god. Prudent at once and daring, he shines a master of
      seamanship, and never the sailor serves with him who would not name him a
      mariner without a flaw. He is born to inspire faith in men. This is as it
      should be, by his own abstract picture of a captain, which he will later
      furnish Doctor Franklin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your captain,&rdquo; he will say, when thus informing that philosopher, &ldquo;your
      captain, Doctor, should have the blind confidence of his sailors. It is
      his beginning, his foundation, wanting which he can be no true captain. To
      his men your captain must he prophet, priest and king. His authority when
      off-shore is necessarily absolute, and therefore the crew should be as one
      man impressed that the captain, like the sovereign, can do no wrong. If a
      captain fail in this, he cannot make up for it by severity, austerity or
      cruelty. Use force, apply restraint, punish as he may, he will always have
      a sullen crew and an unhappy ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nose of the gig grates on the river&rsquo;s bank, and Captain Jack Paul
      leaps ashore. He is greeted by a tall, weather-beaten old man&mdash;grizzled
      and gray. The form of the latter is erect, with a kind of ramrod military
      stiffness. His dress is the rough garb of the Virginia overseer in all
      respects save headgear. Instead of the soft wool hat, common of his sort,
      the old man cocks over his watery left eye a Highland bonnet, and this,
      with its hawk&rsquo;s feather, fastened by a silver clasp, gives to his costume
      a crag and heather aspect altogether Scotch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray old man, with a grinning background of negro slaves, waits for
      the landing of Captain Jack Paul. As the latter springs ashore, the old
      man throws up his hand in a military salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do we find Duncan Macbean!&rdquo; cries Captain Jack Paul. &ldquo;How also is
      my brother! I trust you have still a bale or two of winter-cured tobacco
      left that we may add to our cargo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the tobacco, Captain Paul,&rdquo; returns old Duncan Macbean, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re a
      day or so behind the fair, since the maist of it sailed Englandward a
      month hack, in the brig <i>Flora Belle</i>. As for your brother William of
      whom ye ask, now I s&rsquo;uld say ye were in gude time just to hear his dying
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Duncan Macbean!&rdquo; exclaims Captain Jack Paul. &ldquo;William
      dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, dying! He lies nearer death than he&rsquo;s been any time since he and I
      marched with General Braddock and Colonel Washington, against the red
      salvages of the Ohio. But you s&rsquo;uld come and see him at once, you his born
      brother, and no stand talking here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lung fever, Jack,&rdquo; whispers the sick man, as Captain Jack Paul draws
      a chair to the side of the bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deadly, too; I can feel it. I&rsquo;ll not
      get up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, brother,&rdquo; retorts Captain Jack Paul cheerfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re no
      old man to talk of death&mdash;you, with your fewer than fifty years. I&rsquo;ll
      see you up and on your pins again before I leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>

    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0071.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jack, it&rsquo;s death. And you&rsquo;ve come in good time, too, since there&rsquo;s
      much to talk between us. You know how our cousin left me his heir, if I
      would take his name of Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; continues the dying man, &ldquo;my name since his passing away has
      been William Paul Jones. Now when it is my turn to go, I must tell you
      that, by a clause of the old man&rsquo;s will, he writes you in after me as
      legatee. I&rsquo;m to die, Jack; and you&rsquo;re to have the plantation. Only you
      must clap &lsquo;Jones&rsquo; to your name, and be not John Paul, but John Paul Jones,
      as you take over the estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? I&rsquo;m to heir the plantation after you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So declares the will. On condition, however, that you also take the name
      of Jones. That should not be hard; &lsquo;Jones&rsquo; is one of our family names, and
      he that leaves you the land was our kinsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; cries Captain Jack Paul, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t hesitating for that. Paul
      is a good name, but so also is Jones. Only, I tell you, brother, I hate to
      make my fortune by your death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no common-sense, Jack. I die the easier knowing my going makes way
      for your good luck. And the plantation&rsquo;s a gem, Jack; never a cold or sour
      acre in the whole three thousand, but all of it warm, sweet land. There&rsquo;re
      two thousand acres of woods; and I&rsquo;d leave that stand.&rdquo; The dying man,
      being Scotch, would give advice on his deathbed. &ldquo;The thousand acres now
      under plow are enough.&rdquo; Then, after a pause: &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be content ashore?
      You&rsquo;re young yet; you&rsquo;re not so wedded to the sea, I think, but you&rsquo;ll
      turn planter with good grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear, William. I&rsquo;ve had good fortune by the sea; but then I&rsquo;ve met ill
      fortune also. By and large, I shall be very well content to turn planter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gainful, Jack, being a planter is. Only keep Duncan Macbean by you
      to manage, and he&rsquo;ll turn you in one thousand golden guineas profit every
      Christmas day, and you never to lift hand or give thought to the winning
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the plantation as gainful as that? Now I have but three thousand
      guineas to call mine, after sailing these years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! it&rsquo;s gainful, Jack. If you will work, too, there&rsquo;s that to keep you
      busy. There&rsquo;s the grist mill, the thirty slaves, the forty horses, besides
      the cows and swine and sheep to look after; as well as the negro quarters,
      the tobacco houses, the stables, and the great mansion itself to keep up.
      They&rsquo;ll all serve to fill in the time busily, if you should like it that
      way. Only Jack, with the last of it, always leave everything to Duncan
      Macbean. A rare and wary man is old Duncan, and saving of money down to
      farthings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose sloop is that at the landing!&rdquo; asks Captain Jack Paul, willing to
      shift the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yon sloop! She goes with the plantation; she&rsquo;ll be yours anon,
      brother. And there you are: When the sea calls to you, Jack, as she will
      call, you take the sloop. Cato and Scipio are good sailors, well trained
      to the coast clear away to Charleston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so William Paul Jones dies, and John Paul takes his place on the
      plantation. His name is no longer John Paul, but John Paul Jones; and, as
      his dying brother counselled, he keeps old Duncan Macbean to be the
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his brother is dead, Captain Jack Paul joins his mate, Laurence
      Edgar, on the deck of the <i>Two Friends</i>, swinging tide and tide on
      her anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mate Edgar,&rdquo; says Captain Jack Paul, &ldquo;it is the last time I shall plank
      this quarterdeck as captain. I&rsquo;m to stay; and you&rsquo;re to take the ship home
      to Whitehaven. And now, since you&rsquo;re the captain, and I&rsquo;m no more than a
      guest, suppose you order your cabin boy to get us a bottle of the right
      Madeira, and we&rsquo;ll drink fortune to the bark and her new master.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE FIRST BLOW IN VIRGINIA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is a soundless,
      soft December evening. The quietly falling flakes are cloaking in thin
      white the streets and roofs of Norfolk. Off shore, a cable&rsquo;s length, an
      English sloop of war, eighteen guns, lies tugging at her anchors. In shore
      from the sloop of war rides the peaceful twenty-ton sloop of Planter Paul
      Jones. The sailor-planter, loitering homeward from a cruise to Charleston
      and the coast towns of the Carolinas, is calling on friends in Norfolk.
      Both the war sloop and the peace sloop seem almost deserted in the falling
      snow. Aside from the harbor light burning high in the rigging, and an
      anchor watch of two sailors muffled to the ears, the decks of neither
      craft show signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norfolk&rsquo;s public hall is candle-lighted to a pitch of unusual brilliancy;
      the waxed floors are thronged with the beauty and gentility of the Old
      Dominion, as the same find Norfolk expression. It is indeed a mighty
      social occasion; for the local élite have seized upon the officers of the
      sloop of war, and are giving a ball in their honor. The honored ones
      attend to a man&mdash;which accounts for the deserted look of their sloop&mdash;and
      their gold lace blazes bravely by the light of the candles, and with
      tremendous gala effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones is also among the guests. Since he is in town, his
      coming to the ball becomes the thing most natural. Already he is regarded
      as the Admirable Crichton, of tide-water Virginia, and the function
      wanting his presence would go down to history as incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Jones, planter for two years, has made himself a foremost figure in
      Virginia. Twenty-eight, cultured, travelled, gallant, brilliant, and a
      bachelor, he is welcome in every drawing-room. Besides, is there not the
      Jones plantation, with its mile of river front, its noble mansion house,
      its tobacco teeming acres, its well-trained slaves, and all turning in
      those yearly one thousand yellow guineas under the heedful managing thumb
      of canny Duncan Macbean? Planter Paul Jones is a prince for hospitality,
      too; and the high colonial dames, taking pity on his wifeless state,
      preside at his table, or chaperone the water parties which he gives on his
      great sloop. Also&mdash;still considering his wifelessness&mdash;they seek
      to marry him to one of their colonial daughters.

      In this latter dulcet intrigue, the high colonial dames fail wholly. The
      young planter-sailor is not a marrying man. There is in truth a blushing
      story which lasts throughout a fortnight in which he is quoted as about to
      yield. Rumor gives it confidently forth that the Jones mansion will have a
      mistress, and its master carry altar-ward Betty Parke, the pretty niece of
      Madam Martha Washington. But pretty Betty Parke, in the very face of this
      roseate rumor, becomes Mrs. Tyler, and it will be one of her descendants
      who, seventy-five years later, is chosen President&mdash;a poor President,
      but still a President. Planter Paul Jones rides to the wedding of pretty
      Betty Parke, and gives it his serene and satisfied countenance. From which
      sign it is supposed that Dame Rumor mounts by the wrong stirrup when she
      goes linking the name of pretty Betty Parke with that of Planter Paul
      Jones; and no love-letter scrap, nor private journal note, will ever rise
      from the grave to disparage the assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Planter Paul Jones has thus lived for two years, and moved and had
      his social being among the most beautiful of women, and escaped hand free
      and heart free to tell the tale, is strange to the brink of marvellous. It
      is the more strange since no one could be more than he the knight of
      dames. And he can charm, too&mdash;as witness a letter which two years
      farther on the unimpressionable Doctor Franklin will write to Madam
      d&rsquo;Haudetot:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, my dear madam,&rdquo; the cool philosopher will say, &ldquo;what the
      faults of Paul Jones may be, I must warn your ladyship that when face to
      face with him neither man nor, so far as I learn, woman, can for a moment
      resist the strange magnetism of his presence, the indescribable charm of
      his manner; a commingling of the most compliant deference with the most
      perfect self-esteem that I have ever seen in a man; and above all the
      sweetness of his voice and the purity of his language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul Jones is not alone the darling of colonial drawing-rooms, he is also
      the admiration of the men. This is his description as given by one who
      knew him afloat and ashore:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though of slender build, his neck, arms and shoulders were those of a
      heavy, powerful man. The strength of his arms and shoulders could hardly
      be believed. And he had equal use of both hands, even to writing with the
      left as well as with the right. He was a past master of the art of boxing.
      To this he added a quickness of motion that cannot be described. When
      roused he could strike more blows and cause more havoc in a second than
      any other could strike or cause in a minute. Even when calm and unruffled
      his gait and all his bodily motions were those of the panther&mdash;noiseless,
      sleek, the perfection of grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The above, by way of portrait: When one adds to it that Planter Paul Jones
      rides like a Prince Rupert, fences like a Crillon, gives blows with his
      fist that would stagger Jack Slack, and is death itself with either gun or
      pistol, it will be seen how he owns every quality that should pedestal him
      as a paragon in the best circles of his day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is towards the hour of midnight when Planter Paul Jones, attired like a
      Brummel, stands in quiet converse with his friend Mr. Hurst. Their talk
      runs on the state of sentiment in the colonies, and the chance of trouble
      with the motherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hostilities are certain, my dear Hurst,&rdquo; says Planter Paul Jones. &ldquo;I hear
      it from Colonel Washington, Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Henry. They make no
      secret of it in Williamsburg about the House of Burgesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other colonies&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morris of Philadelphia, as well as Mr. Pynckney of Charleston, agrees
      with the gentlemen I&rsquo;ve quoted. They say, sir, there will soon be an
      outbreak in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Boston!&rdquo; repeats Mr. Hurst doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the Massachusetts men the courage, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, ay! and the strength, my friend! Both Colonel Washington and Mr.
      Jefferson assured me that, although slow to anger, they are true sons of
      Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall be our attitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must sustain them at all hazards, sir&mdash;sustain them to the
      death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is now that a knot of English officers drift up&mdash;a little flushed
      of wine, are these guests of honor. They, too, have been talking, albeit
      thickly, of a possible future full of trouble for the colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was observing,&rdquo; says Lieutenant Parker, addressing Planter Paul Jones
      and Mr. Hurst, &ldquo;that the insolence of the Americans, which is more or less
      in exhibition all the way from Boston to Savannah, will never get beyond
      words. There will be no blows struck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you so confident?&rdquo; asks Planter Paul Jones, eye agate, voice
      purringly soft. &ldquo;Now I should say that, given provocation, the colonies
      would strike a blow, and a heavy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you sail?&rdquo; interrupts Mr. Hurst, speaking to Lieutenant Parker.
      Mr. Hurst would shift conversation to less perilous ground. As a mover of
      the ball, he is in sort host to the officers, as well as to Planter Paul
      Jones, and for the white credit of the town desires a peaceful evening. &ldquo;I
      hear,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;that your sloop is for a cruise off the French
      coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and the fleet she belongs to,&rdquo; responds Lieutenant Parker, utterance
      somewhat blurred, &ldquo;will remain on this station while a word of rebel talk
      continues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, instead of keeping you here,&rdquo; breaks in Planter Paul Jones,
      vivaciously, &ldquo;to hector peaceful colonies, if I were your king I should
      send you to wrest Cape Good Hope from the Dutch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cape Good Hope from the Dutch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the Isles of France and Bourbon from the French&mdash;lying, as they
      do, like lions in the pathway to our Indian possessions. If I were your
      king, I say, those would be the tasks I&rsquo;d set you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you say &lsquo;your king?&rsquo; Is he not also <i>your</i> king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, I might be pleasantly willing,&rdquo; observes Planter Paul Jones
      airily, &ldquo;to give you my share in King George. In any event, I do not
      propose that you shall examine into my allegiance. And I say again that,
      if I were your king, sir, I&rsquo;d find you better English work to do than an
      irritating and foolish patrol of these coasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of the Americans striking a blow,&rdquo; says Lieutenant Parker, who
      is gifted of that pertinacity of memory common to half-drunken men; &ldquo;you
      spoke but a moment back of the Americans striking a blow, and a heavy
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir! a blow&mdash;given provocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Parker wags his head with an air of sagacity both bibulous and
      supercilious. He smiles victoriously, as a fortunate comparison bobs up to
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blow!&rdquo; he murmurs. Then, fixing Planter Paul Jones with an eye of
      bleary scorn: &ldquo;The Americans would be quickly lashed into their kennels
      again. The more easily, if the courage of the American men, as I think&rsquo;s
      the case, is no more firmly founded than the chastity of the American
      women.&rdquo;

      Planter Paul Jones deals Lieutenant Parker a blow with his clenched fist,
      the like of which was never before seen even in the violent port of
      Norfolk. Lieutenant Parker&rsquo;s nose is crushed flat with his face; he falls
      like some pole-axed ox. His fellow-officers lift him to his feet,
      bleeding, stunned beyond words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear from us!&rdquo; is the fierce cry from his comrades, as they
      hurry the stricken Parker from the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be pleased to hear from any or all of you,&rdquo; replies Planter Paul
      Jones; &ldquo;or from what other dogs in king&rsquo;s coats shall question the honor
      of American women.&rdquo; Then, turning to Mr. Hurst: &ldquo;You, sir, shall act for
      me! Accept every challenge they send! Make it pistols, ten paces, with
      Craney Island for the place; and fix the time to suit their English
      convenience.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE BLAST OF WAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>orfolk is never
      more at peace than on the day succeeding the ball. There is no challenge,
      no duel. Planter Paul Jones waits to hear from Lieutenant Parker; at first
      hopefully; in the end, when nothing comes, with doubtful brow of grief. Is
      it that Lieutenant Parker will not fight? Planter Paul Jones hears the
      suggestion from his friend Mr. Hurst with polite scorn. Such heresy is
      beyond reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>must</i> fight,&rdquo; urges Planter Paul Jones, desperately keeping
      alive the fires of his hope. &ldquo;He will fight, if for no other reason, then
      because it is his trade. Lieutenant Parker is pugnacious by profession;
      that of itself will make him toe the peg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones is wrong. Lieutenant Parker never shows his beaten face
      on American soil again. Nor does any bellicose gentleman appear for
      Lieutenant Parker, or propose to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last omission gives Planter Paul Jones as sharp a pang as though he
      has been slighted by some dearest friend. Having on his own part a native
      lust for battle, it bewilders him when so excellent a foundation for a
      duel falls into neglect, and no architect of combat steps forward to build
      thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to be understood!&rdquo; observes Planter Paul Jones dejectedly,
      after the sloop of war, with Lieutenant Parker and those others of that
      gold-lace coterie, has sailed away, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not to be understood! Surely,
      there must have been one gentleman among them who, free to do so, would
      have called me to account.&rdquo; Then, with solemn sadness: &ldquo;I am convinced
      that their admiral interfered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who shall say? The admiral is the paternal uncle of Lieutenant Parker of
      the crushed and broken nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story will go later to England to the explanatory effect that no
      fellow-officer would act for Lieutenant Parker. However, in doubt of this,
      that last named imprudent person&mdash;wearing the marks of Planter Paul
      Jones&rsquo; rebuke for many a day&mdash;is not dismissed the king&rsquo;s service. He
      will be in the fight off Fort Moultrie, where&mdash;unlike Sergeant Jasper
      of the Americans&mdash;he in no wise is to distinguish himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones, when every final chance of the trouble for which he
      longs has departed with the departure of the war sloop, sorrowfully steers
      the peace sloop back to his plantation by the Rappahannock; and thereafter
      he does his best to forget an incident that&mdash;because of the
      mysterious tameness of the English, under conditions which should have
      brought them ferociously to the field&mdash;gives him an aching sense of
      pain. He says to Mr. Hurst, when about to spread his small canvas and sail
      away for home, &ldquo;It is one of those experiences, sir, that shake a man&rsquo;s
      faith in his kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonial dames get hold of the tale, and
    </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones becomes all the more the petted darling of the
      drawing-rooms. This of itself is a destiny most friendly to his taste; for
      our Virginia Bayard lives not without his tender vanities. Bright eyes are
      more beautiful than stars; and he can sigh, or whisper a sonnet, or softly
      press a little hand. Also, having in his composition an ardent dash of the
      peacock, he is capable, with fair ladies looking on, of a decorous, albeit
      a resplendent strut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four months, dating from the disaster to Lieutenant Parker&rsquo;s nose, have
      squeezed through the gates of a narrow present, and merged with those
      other countless months which together make the past. It is a muggy April
      morning, and New York City, panting with its metropolitan population of
      forty thousand, is soaked to the bone. Little squalls of rain follow each
      other in gusty procession. Between the squalls the sun shines forth, and
      sets the world a-steam. After each of these intermittent bursts of glory,
      the sun is again blotted ont by a black flurry of clouds, and another
      shower sets in.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in William Street that the reader comes across the lithe figure of
      Planter Paul Jones. That restless tobacco grower, with his two aquatic
      slaves, Scipio and Cato, in the little sloop, has been knocking about the
      eastern shore for ducks. A sudden change of plan now brings him to New
      York, with a final purpose of extending his voyage as far as Boston.
      Planter Paul Jones is in a mood to know the Yankees better, and come by
      some guess of his own as to how soon our Puritan bulldogs may be expected
      to fly at the English throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he goes briskly northward along William Street, even through his
      landsman&rsquo;s garb there shows much that is marine. Also, he evinces a
      sailor&rsquo;s contempt for the dripping weather, plowing ahead through shine
      and through shower as though in the catalogue of the disagreeable there is
      no such word as a wetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of John Street, Planter Paul Jones comes upon a lean, prim
      personage. By his severe air the latter gentleman is evidently an
      individual of consequence. The severe gentleman, with a prudent care for
      his coat in direct contrast to the weather-carelessness of the other, has
      taken refuge in the safe harborage of a doorway. From the dry vantage
      thereof he cranes his neck in a tentative way, the better to survey the
      heavens. Plainly he desires a guarantee, in favor of some partial space of
      sunshine, before he again ventures abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Planter Paul Jones comes up, both he and the severe gentleman gaze at
      each other for one moment. Then their hands are caught in a warm exchange
      of greetings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Livingston, by my word!&rdquo; cries Planter Paul Jones, shaking the severe
      gentleman&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul Jones!&rdquo; exclaims the severe gentleman, returning the handshake, but
      with due regard to the pompous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this is what I term fortunate!&rdquo; says Planter Paul Jones, releasing
      the other&rsquo;s fingers. &ldquo;I was on my way to your house to ask for letters of
      introduction to Mr. Hancock and others in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boston! Surely you have heard the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News? I&rsquo;ve heard nothing. For six weeks I&rsquo;ve been anywhere between
      Barnegat and the inner Chesapeake in my sloop. I tied up at the foot of
      Whitehall Street within the hour, and you&rsquo;re the first I&rsquo;ve spoken with
      since I stepped ashore. What is this news that makes you stare at the name
      of Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve not heard!&rdquo; repeats Mr. Livingston. Then, with a look at once
      somber and solemn: &ldquo;Black news! Black news, indeed! I&rsquo;m on my way to
      Hanover Square to have it set in types, and scattered up and down the
      town. Come; you shall go with me. I&rsquo;ll talk as we walk along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Livingston takes Planter Paul Jones by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black news!&rdquo; he resumes. &ldquo;The Massachusetts men have attacked the British
      at Lexington and Concord; my despatches, while necessarily meager, declare
      that the British were disgracefully beaten, and lost, killed and wounded,
      several hundred soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call that black news?&rdquo; interjects Planter Paul Jones, his eye
      finely aflame. &ldquo;To my mind now it is as good news as ever I hope to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say so! It fills me with measureless gloom. I cannot but look
      ahead and wonder where it will end. And yet we should hope for the best.&rdquo;
       The speaker heaves a weary sigh. &ldquo;Possibly the mother country may learn
      from this experience how bitterly in earnest Americans are, and be thereby
      led to mitigate the harshness of her attitude toward us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones looks his emphatic disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no softening of England&rsquo;s attitude. Believe me, sir, I&rsquo;m
      not so long out of London, but what I&rsquo;m clear as to the plans and purposes
      of King George and his ministers. The Tories have deliberately forced the
      present situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forced the situation! You amaze me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my name is not Paul Jones, if it be not the deliberate design of
      King George and his advisers to bring about a clash between England and
      these colonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to what end, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give them an excuse for imposing martial law upon us. They will pour a
      cataract of redcoats upon our shores. Musket in fist, cannon to back them,
      they will disperse our legislatures, take away our charters of
      self-government. That blood at Concord and Lexington gives them the
      pretext for which they schemed. They can now call us &lsquo;rebels;&rsquo; and,
      calling us &lsquo;rebels,&rsquo; they will try to reduce us&mdash;for all our white
      skins and freeborn blood&mdash;to the slavish status of Hindostan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Livingston stares, while this long speech is reeled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; he asks at last, &ldquo;that we are the victims of a Tory
      plot? Am I to understand that Concord and Lexington were aimed at by the
      king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so; and for one I&rsquo;m glad the issue&rsquo;s made. We have now but the
      one alternative. We may choose between abject slavery and war to the
      hilts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s severely pompons face, as the iron truth begins to
      overcome him, assumes an expression at once noble and high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if such be the Tory design, war we shall have.&rdquo;
       Then, following a pause: &ldquo;And what is to be your course in case of war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take my part in it, never fear! This very day I shall write to
      friends who will have seats in the Congress that meets next month in
      Philadelphia, and ask them to wear my name in their minds. I am theirs so
      soon as ever they have a plank afloat to put me on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair, earnestly talking, reach Hanover Square, and pause in front of
      &ldquo;The Bible and Crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; says Mr. Livingston. &ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;ll but wait until I give
      orders to Master Rivington, as to how he shall print and circulate my
      despatches, I&rsquo;ll have you up to the house, where we can further consider
      this business over a bottle of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that you will excuse me,&rdquo; returns Planter Paul Jones. He has been
      making plans of his own while they talked. &ldquo;I trust you will pardon me;
      but I shall have no more than time to write and post my letters, and get
      away on the ebb tide. Three days from now I must be at my plantation by
      the Rappahannock, putting all in order for the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; cries Mr. Livingston, as he and Planter Paul Jones shake bands
      at parting, &ldquo;my brother Philip will be in the coming Congress. You have
      but to go to him, he is as much your friend as is either Mr. Washington or
      Mr. Jefferson. I shall speak to Philip of you before the day is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to your brother,&rdquo; returns Planter Paul Jones, &ldquo;that I shall come to
      him among the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The winds generously flatter the little sloop on her return voyage. She
      came north slowly, reluctantly; now, with the wind aft and all but blowing
      a gale, she flies southward like a bird. As Planter Paul Jones boasted,
      within the three days after seeing the last of Sandy Hook, he steps ashore
      on his own domain by the Rappahannock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cato and Scipio grin in exultation. In a pardonable anxiety to open the
      eyes of plodding fellow-slaves of the tobacco fields, they mendaciously
      shorten the sailing time out of New York by forty-eight hours, and declare
      that Planter Paul Jones brought the sloop home in a single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Potch um home, Marse Paul does, faster than a wil&rsquo; duck could trabble!&rdquo;
       is their story. Thereupon, the innocent tobacco blacks marvel,
      openmouthed, at the far-travelled Cato, and Scipio of the many
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planter Paul Jones, on whom a war-fever is growing, plunges into immediate
      conference with Duncan Macbean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much free money can we make?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Highlander scratches his grizzled locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thoughtfully considers the inside of his Glengarry bonnet, which
      he takes from his head for that purpose. One would think, from his long
      study of it, that he keeps his accounts in its linings. The inspection
      being over, he puts it back on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there s&rsquo;uld be the matter of three thousand guineas in gold in
      Williamsburg,&rdquo; returns old Duncan Macbean; &ldquo;besides a hunner or so siller
      in the house. I can gi&rsquo; ye three thousand guineas, and never miss the feel
      o&rsquo; them, gin that&rsquo;ll be enou&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand guineas! What time I shall be in Philadelphia it should
      keep a king! Have it set to my credit, Duncan, in Mr. Ross&rsquo; bank in
      Chestnut Street in that town. I shall go there as soon as Congress
      convenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will ye no be back home agen?&rdquo; asks Duncan, his bronzed cheek a
      trifle white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s war&mdash;and, take it from me, there will be&mdash;I shall
      not return. I hope to sail in the first warship that flies the colors of
      the Colonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, grasping old Duncan&rsquo;s hand in a grip of steel: &ldquo;You stay here and
      run the plantation, old friend! Wherever I am, I shall know that all is
      right ashore while you are here. For I can trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! ye can trust me; no fear o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; and the water stands in the old
      eyes.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE PLANTER TURNS LIEUTENANT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was Mr. Adams
      who opposed you. The best place I could make was that of lieutenant. Mr.
      Adams wouldn&rsquo;t hear of you as a captain; and since, with General
      Washington, Virginia and the Southern Colonies have been given control of
      the Army, his claim of the Navy for Massachusetts and the Northern
      Colonies finds general consent. Commodore Hopkins and four of the five
      captains, beginning with Mr. Adams&rsquo; protégé Dudley Saltonstall, go to New
      England. The most that I could make Mr. Adams agree to, was that you
      should be set at the head of the list of lieutenants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, sir, that Mr. Adams holds a poor opinion of me.&rdquo; This with a
      sigh. &ldquo;It was my dream to be a captain, and have a ship of my own.
      However, I am here to serve the cause, rather than promote the personal
      fortunes of Paul Jones. Let the list go as it is; the future doubtless
      will bring all things straight. I am free to say, however, that from the
      selections made by Mr. Adams, as you repeat them, I think he has provided
      for more courts-martial than victories.&rdquo; The two gentlemen in talk are Mr.
      Hewes, member of the Colonial Congress from North Carolina, and Planter
      Paul Jones. Mr. Hewes is old and worn and sick, and only his granite
      resolution keeps him at the seat of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hancock,&rdquo; continues Mr. Hewes, &ldquo;is also from Massachusetts, and as
      chairman of our committee he gave Mr. Adams what aid he could. There&rsquo;s one
      honor you may have, however; I arranged for that. The issuance of the
      commissions is with Mr. Hancock, and if you&rsquo;ll accompany me to the Hall
      you will be given yours at once. That will make you the first, if not the
      highest, naval officer of the Colonies to be commissioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what ship am I to serve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Alfred</i>, Captain Saltonstall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raw and bleak sweep the December winds through the bare streets, as the
      two go on their way to the Hall, where Congress holds its sittings.
      Fortunately, as Lieutenant Paul Jones phrases it, the wind is &ldquo;aft,&rdquo; and
      so Mr. Hewes, despite his weakness, makes better weather of it than one
      would look for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a carriage home,&rdquo; says he, panting a little, as the stiff
      breeze steals his breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; breaks forth Lieutenant Paul Jones, after an interval of
      silence&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me make out how I incurred the
      enmity of Mr. Adams. I&rsquo;ve never set foot in Boston, never clapped my eyes
      on him before I came to this city last July.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hewes smiles. &ldquo;You sacrificed interest to epigram,&rdquo; says he.
      Lieutenant Paul Jones glares in wonder. &ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; goes on Mr.
      Hewes, answering the look. &ldquo;Do you recall meeting Mr. Adams at Colonel
      Carroll&rsquo;s house out near Schuylkill Falls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was last October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! Mr. Adams&rsquo; memory is quite equal to last October. The more, if
      the event remembered were a dig to his vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dig to his vanity!&rdquo; repeats Lieutenant Paul Jones in astonishment. &ldquo;I
      cannot now recall that I so much as spoke a word to the old polar bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a word spoken <i>to</i> him, but one spoken <i>of</i> him. This
      is it: Mr. Adams told an anecdote in French to little Betty Faulkner.
      Later you must needs be witty, and whisper to Miss Betty a satirical word
      anent Mr. Adams&rsquo; French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; interjects Lieutenant Paul Jones, with a whimsical grin,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I said. &lsquo;It is fortunate,&rsquo; I observed to Miss Betty,
      &lsquo;that Mr. Adams&rsquo; sentiments are not so English as is his French. If they
      were, he would far and away be the greatest Tory in the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; chuckles Mr. Hewes. &ldquo;And, doubtless, all very true. None the
      less, my young friend, your brightness cost you a captaincy. The <i>mot</i>
      was too good to keep, and little Betty started it on a journey that landed
      it, at a fourth telling, slap in the outraged ear of Mr. Adams himself.
      Make you a captain? He would as soon think of making you rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair trudged on in silence, Mr. Hewes turning about in his mind sundry
      matters of colonial policy, while Lieutenant Paul Jones solaces himself by
      recalling how it is the even year to a day since that Norfolk ball, when
      he smote upon the scandalous nose of Lieutenant Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m a lieutenant like himself,&rdquo; runs the warlike cogitations of
      Lieutenant Paul Jones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d prodigiously enjoy meeting the scoundrel
      afloat. I might teach his dullness a better opinion of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Paul Jones for months has been hard at work; one day in
      conference with the Marine Committee, leading them by the light of his
      ship-knowledge; the next busy with adz and oakum and calking iron,
      repairing and renewing the tottering hulks which the agents of the
      colonies have collected as the nucleus of the baby navy. Over this very
      ship the <i>Alfred</i>, on which he is to sail lieutenant, he has toiled
      as though it were intended as a present for his bride. He confidently
      counted on being made its captain; now to sail as a subordinate, when he
      looked to have command, is a bitter disappointment. Sail he will, however,
      and that without murmur; for he is too much the patriot to hang back, too
      strong a heart to sulk. Besides, he has the optimism of the born war dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given open war,&rdquo; thinks he, &ldquo;what more should one ask than a cutlass, and
      the chance to use it? Once we&rsquo;re aboard an enemy, it shall go hard, but I
      carve a captaincy out of the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Congress is not in session upon this particular day, and Mr. Hewes leads
      Lieutenant Paul Jones straight to Chairman Hancock of the Marine
      Committee. That eminent patriot is in his committee room. He is big,
      florid, proud, and, like all the Massachusetts men since Concord and
      Lexington, a bit puffed up. No presentation is needed; Mr. Hancock and
      Lieutenant Paul Jones have been acquainted for months. The big
      merchant-statesman beams pleasantly on the new lieutenant. Then he draws
      Mr. Hewes into a far window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s got into Adams,&rdquo; says Mr. Hancock, lowering his voice
      to a whisper. &ldquo;He burst in here a moment ago, and declared that he meant
      to move, at the next session, a reconsideration of the appointment of our
      young friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now where pinches the shoe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that Paul Jones isn&rsquo;t two years out of England; that his
      sympathies must needs lean toward King George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be news if the patriotism of Mr. Adams himself stands as near the
      perpendicular as does that of Paul Jones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And next he urges that our friend is a man of no family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, did one ever hear such aristocratic bosh! The more, since our cause
      is the cause of human rights, and our shout &lsquo;Democracy!&rsquo; I shall take
      occasion, when next I have the honor to meet Mr. Adams&rdquo;&mdash;here the
      eyes of the old North Carolinian begin to sparkle&mdash;&ldquo;to mention this
      subject of families, and remind him that it might worry the Herald&rsquo;s
      College excessively, if that seminary of pedigrees were called upon to
      back-track his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear sir!&rdquo; and the merchant-statesman, full of lofty
      mollifications, makes a soothing gesture with his hands. &ldquo;For all our
      sakes, say nothing to Mr. Adams! You recall what Doctor Franklin remarked
      of him: &lsquo;He is always honest, sometimes great, but often mad.&rsquo; Let us
      suppose him merely mad; and so forgive him. We may do it the more easily,
      since I told him that, even if his objections were valid, he was miles too
      late, the question of that lieutenancy having been already passed upon and
      settled. Let us forget Adams, and give Paul Jones his commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lieutenant Paul Jones receives his commission from Mr. Hancock, the
      latter remarks with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the first commission issued, Lieutenant Jones. If the simile
      were permissible concerning anything that refers to the sea, I should say
      now that, in making you a lieutenant, we lay the corner stone of the
      American Navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0101.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Paul Jones bows his thanks, but speaks never a word. This
      silence arises from the deep emotions that hold him in their strong grip,
      not from churlishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; observes Mr. Hewes, who is thinking only of heaping extra honor
      on his young friend, &ldquo;since we have a fully commissioned officer to
      perform the ceremony, suppose we make memorable the day by going down to
      the <i>Alfred</i> and &lsquo;breaking out&rsquo; its pennant. Thus, almost with the
      breath in which we commission our first officer, we will have also
      commissioned our first regular ship of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be better,&rdquo; interposes Mr. Hancock, thinking on the possible
      angers of Mr. Adams, &ldquo;to wait for the coming from Boston of Captain
      Saltonstall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hewes thinks it would not. Since Mr. Hewes&rsquo; manner in thus thinking is
      just a trifle iron-bound, not to say acrid, Mr. Hancock decides that,
      after all, there may be more peril in waiting for Captain Saltonstall than
      in going forward with Lieutenant Jones. Whereupon, Mr. Hewes, Mr. Hancock
      and Lieutenant Jones depart for the <i>Alfred</i>, which lies at the foot
      of Chestnut Street. In the main hall of Congress the three pick up Colonel
      Carroll, Mad Anthony Wayne. Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Livingston, and Mr. Morris.
      These gentlemen, regarding the event as the formal birth of the new navy,
      decide to accompany the others in the rôle of witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flag is ready in the lockers of the <i>Alfred</i>&mdash;a pine tree, a
      rattlesnake, with the words &ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t Tread on Me</i>.&rdquo; Lieutenant Paul
      Jones, as he shakes out the bunting, surveys the device with no favoring
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0113.jpg" alt="0113 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0113.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ever,&rdquo; observes Lieutenant Paul Jones, looking at Mr. Hewes but
      speaking to all&mdash;&ldquo;I was ever curious to know by whose queer fancy
      that device was adopted. It is beyond me to fathom how a venomous serpent
      could be regarded as the emblem of a brave and honest people fighting to
      be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After delivering this opinion, which is tacitly agreed to by the others,
      the flag is bent on the halyards, and &ldquo;broken out.&rdquo; Also, a ration of grog
      is issued to the crew&mdash;so far as the <i>Alfred</i> is blessed with a
      crew&mdash;by way of fixing the momentous occasion in the forecastle mind.
      The crew cheers; but whether the cheers are for the grog, or Lieutenant
      Paul Jones who orders it, or the rattlesnake pine tree ensign that causes
      the order, no one may say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the &ldquo;breaking out,&rdquo; the grog and the cheers, Mr. Hewes, Mr.
      Hancock and their fellow-statesmen, retire&mdash;the day being over cold&mdash;to
      the land, while Lieutenant Paul Jones, now and until the coming of Captain
      Saltonstall in command of the <i>Alfred</i>, remains aboard to take up his
      duty as a regularly commissioned officer in the regular navy of the
      colonies.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE CRUISE OF THE &ldquo;PROVIDENCE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>our ships&mdash;the
      <i>Alfred</i>, Captain Saltonstall, in the van, with Commodore Hopkins in
      command of the squadron&mdash;sail away on a rainy February day. They
      clear Cape Henlopen, and turn their untried prows south by east half
      south. The fell purpose of Commodore Hopkins is to harry the Bahamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be nowhere written that Commodore Hopkins, in his designs upon the
      Bahamas, in any degree succeeds. Eight weeks later, the four ships come
      scudding into New London with the fear of death in their hearts. An
      English sloop of war darted upon them, they say, off the eastern end of
      Long Island, and they escaped by the paint on their planks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Paul Jones of the <i>Alfred</i> is afire with anger and chagrin
      at the miserable failure of the cruise, and goes furiously ashore, nursing
      a purpose of charging both Commodore Hopkins and Captain Saltonstall with
      every maritime offence, from sea-idiocy to cowardice. He is cooled off by
      older and more prudent heads. Also, Commodore Hopkins is summarily
      dismissed by Congress, while Captain Saltonstall takes refuge behind the
      broad skirts of his patron Mr. Adams. Thus, that first luckless cruise of
      the infant navy, conceived in ignorance and in politics brought forth,
      achieves its dismal finale in investigations, votes of censure, and
      dismissals, a situation which goes far to justify those December
      prophecies of Lieutenant Paul Jones, that Mr. Adams, by his selections for
      commodore and captains, arranged for more courts-martial than victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has one excellent result, however; it teaches Congress to give
      Lieutenant Paul Jones the sloop <i>Providence</i>, and send him to sea
      with a command of his own. With him go his faithful blacks, Scipio and
      Cato; also, as &ldquo;port-fire,&rdquo; a red Indian of the Narragansett tribe, one
      Anthony Jeremiah of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little sloop&mdash;about as big as a gentleman&rsquo;s yacht, she is&mdash;clears
      on a brilliant day in June. For weeks she ranges from Newfoundland to the
      Bermudas&mdash;seas sown with English ships of war. Boatswain Jack
      Robinson holds this converse with Polly his virtuous wife, when the <i>Providence</i>
      again gets its anchors down in friendly Yankee mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do, Jack?&rdquo; demands wife Polly, now she has him safe
      ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what he&mdash;that&rsquo;s the captain&mdash;does, when first we
      puts to sea. He&rsquo;s only a leftenant&mdash;Leftenant Paul Jones; but he
      ought to be a captain, and so, d&rsquo;ye see, my girl, I&rsquo;ll call him captain.
      What does the captain do, says you, when once he&rsquo;s afloat? As sure as
      you&rsquo;re on my knee, Polly, no sooner be we off soundings than he passes the
      word for&rsquo;ard for me to fetch him the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails&mdash;me being
      bo&rsquo;sen. Aft I tumbles, cat and all, wondering who&rsquo;s to have the dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Chuck it overboard, Jack!&rsquo; says he, like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Chuck what, capt&rsquo;n?&rsquo; says I, giving my forelock a tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Chuck the cat!&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The cat?&rsquo; says I, being as you might say taken a-back, and wondering is
      it rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ay! the cat!&rsquo; he says. Then, looking me over with an eye like a coal, he
      goes on: &lsquo;I can keep order aboard my ship without the cat. Because why;
      because I&rsquo;m the best man aboard her,&rsquo; he says; and there you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did the cat go overboard, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overboard of course, Polly. And being nicely fitted with little knobs of
      lead on the nine tails of her, down to the bottom like a solid shot goes
      she. And so, d&rsquo;ye see, we goes cruising without the cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take no prizes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sunk eight, and sent eight more into Boston with prize crews aboard.
      Good picking, too, they was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had no battles then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No battles, Polly; and yet, at the close of the cruise, we&rsquo;re all but
      done for by a seventy-four gun frigate off Montauk. The captain twists us
      out of the frigate&rsquo;s mouth by sheer seamanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how was that, Jack!&rdquo; cries Polly, breathless and all ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We comes poking &lsquo;round the point, d&rsquo;ye see, and runs blind into her. We
      beats to wind&rsquo;ard; so does the frigate. And she lays as close to the wind
      as we&mdash;and closer, Polly. Just as she thinks she has only to reach
      out and snap us up, the captain&mdash;he has the wheel himself&mdash;wears
      suddenly round under easy helm, and gets the wind free. This sort o&rsquo; takes
      the frigate by surprise, and, instead of wearing, she starts to box about.
      She&rsquo;s standing as close-hauled as her trim will bear at the time. So, as I
      says, as he wears &lsquo;round, the frigate jams her helm down, and luffs into
      the teeth of the gale. There&rsquo;s a squall cat&rsquo;s-pawing to wind&rsquo;ard that she
      ought to have seen, and would if she&rsquo;d had our captain. But she never
      notices. So, d&rsquo;ye see, my girl, the frigate don&rsquo;t hold her luff, and next
      the squall takes her in the face. She loses her steering way, gets took
      aback; and we showing a clean pair of heels, with the wind free, on the
      sloop&rsquo;s best point of sailing. And there you be: We leaves the frigate to
      clear her sheets and reeve preventers at her leisure&mdash;we snapping
      muskets at her from our taffer-rail, by way of insult, Polly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your captain&rsquo;s too daring, Jack,&rdquo; says Polly, who is a prudent woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I tells him, Polly. &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;discretion is the
      better part of valor.&rsquo; At that he gives me a wink. &lsquo;So it is, my mate,&rsquo;
      says he, &lsquo;and damned impudence is the better part of discretion. And now,&rsquo;
      says he, &lsquo;the frigate being all but hulldown astern, you may take this
      wheel yourself, while I goes down to supper.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lieutenant Paul Jones is again on dry land, he finds two pieces of
      news awaiting him. One is a letter from Mr. Jefferson, enclosing his
      commission as a captain fully fledged. The other is old Duncan Macbean in
      person, and his sunken cheek and leaden eye tell of troubles on the
      far-off Rappahannock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Lord Dunmore,&rdquo; says old Duncan, very pale, his voice a-quaver. &ldquo;He
      heard of you among the ships, and wanted revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the villain took it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, he took it like! He burned mansion, barn, flour-mill&mdash;every
      building&rsquo;s gone, and never stick nor stone to stand one a-top t&rsquo;ither on
      the whole plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He killed sheep and swine and cattle, and drove away the horses; there&rsquo;s
      never the hoof left walking about the place. Nothing but the stripped land
      is left ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the slaves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship took them, too, to sell them in Jamaica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones turns white as linen three times bleached. His eyes are
      hard as jade. Then he tosses up his hands, with a motion of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor blacks!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;The plantation was to them a home, not a
      place of bondage. Now they are torn away, to die of pestilence or under
      the lash, in the cane fields of Jamaica. The price of their poor bodies is
      to swell the pockets of our noble English slave-trader. This may be Lord
      Dunmore&rsquo;s notion of civilized war. For all that I shall one day exact a
      reckoning.&rdquo; Then, resting his hand on old Duncan&rsquo;s shoulder: &ldquo;However, we
      have seen worse campaigns, old friend! We&rsquo;ll do well yet! I&rsquo;ve still one
      fortune&mdash;my sword; still one prospect&mdash;the prospect of laying
      alongside the enemy.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;THE COUNSEL OF CADWALADER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>hiladelphia is
      experiencing a cool June, and in a sober, Quakerish way shows grateful for
      it. The windows of General Washington&rsquo;s apartments, looking out into
      Chestnut Street, are raised to let in the weather and the urbane sun, not
      too hot, not too cool, casts a slanting glance into the room, as though
      moved of a solar curiosity concerning the mighty one who inhabits them.
      The sun, doubtless, goes his way fully satisfied; General Washington
      himself is there, in casual talk with the Marquis de Lafayette.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a marked difference between the General and the Marquis; the
      former tall, powerful, indomitable&mdash;the type American; the latter
      nervous, optimistic, full of romantic heroisms&mdash;the type French. The
      General is speaking; his manner a model of the courteous and the suave.
      For the young Marquis is a peer of France, the head of a party, and may be
      held as carrying at his heels a third of French sentiment and French
      influence. It is not what he brings, but what he leaves behind him, that
      makes the young Marquis important.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk between the General and the Marquis is running on Captain Paul
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surprises me,&rdquo; the General is saying, &ldquo;it surprises me, my dear
      Marquis, to learn that you know Captain Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meet&mdash;Captaine Jones and I,&rdquo; responds Lafayette, in a choppy,
      fervent fashion of English, that carries something more than a mere flavor
      of Paris, &ldquo;we meet, my dear General, in Alexandria by the Potomac, when I
      come North from the Carolina, where I disbark. Captaine Jones he assist in
      Alexandria to find horses to bring me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe, as does he, that a best use that can be made of him is
      to give him a ship, and send him to Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certaine, General, certaine! Give him a good ship, and let him hawk at
      England with it. It should be a quick, smart ship, that they may not catch
      him. Give him such a vessel, General, and he will keep five hundred
      English boats at home to guard the British coasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, Marquis, that he would make a good impression in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best, General; the best! Captaine Jones has&mdash;what you call?&mdash;the
      aplomb, yes, and the grace, the charm, the dash to captivate the fancy of
      my countrymen&mdash;ever brave, the French, they love a brave man like
      Captaine Jones! More, General, he speaks the French language, and that is
      most important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Washington stalks up and down the polished, hardwood floor,
      wearing a thoughtful face. As he turns to speak, he is interrupted by an
      obsequious black attendant&mdash;one of those body slaves brought from
      Mount Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Gin&rsquo;ral,&rdquo; says the grizzled old darky, as he pokes his grinning
      head in at the door; &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Jones presents his comp&rsquo;ments, sare; an&rsquo; can
      he come up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Washington makes a sign of assent, and the grizzled old servitor
      smirks and smiles and bows himself backward into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two pairs of feet heard climbing the stair; the elastic step
      belongs to Captain Paul Jones, the more stolid is that of Mr. Morris, who,
      using the familiarity of a closest friendship, walks in on General
      Washington unannounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis was just saying,&rdquo; observes General Washington to Captain Paul
      Jones, when greetings are over and conversation, to employ a nautical
      phrase, has settled to its lines, &ldquo;that he met you in Virginia as he came
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General; I had been having a look at my plantation, which Lord
      Dunmore did me the honor to lay waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the destruction great?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The torch had been everywhere. The work could not have been more complete
      had his Lordship been a professional incendiary.&rdquo; Captain Paul Jones
      shrugs his wide shoulders, as though dismissing a disagreeable subject,
      one not to be helped by talk: &ldquo;You received my letter, General? I was so
      rash as to think you might aid me in getting the new frigate <i>Trumbull</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; returns General Washington, &ldquo;you will understand that my
      connection with the army makes any interference on my part in naval
      affairs a most delicate business. I must give my counsel in that quarter
      cautiously. As for the <i>Trumbull</i>; it is, I fear, already claimed by
      Mr. Adams for Captain Saltonstall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Saltonstall!&rdquo; cries Captain Paul Jones in a fervor of bitterness.
      &ldquo;General, hear me! I sailed lieutenant in the <i>Alfred</i> with Captain
      Saltonstall. I know him, and do not scruple to say that he is an
      incompetent coward. Since he went ashore in New London after that
      disgraceful cruise, he hasn&rsquo;t shown his face aboard ship. He was ashamed
      to do so. Only Mr. Adams could have protected him from the court-martial
      he had earned. On my side&mdash;if I must plead my own cause&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      made two cruises since then, one in the <i>Providence</i>, one in the <i>Alfred</i>.
      I&rsquo;ve taken twenty-four prizes; some of them by no means unimportant to the
      American cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; interrupts General Washington, his steady face lighting up a
      trifle; &ldquo;you mean the <i>Mellish</i> and the <i>Bideford</i>. I heard how
      you captured the winter equipment meant for Howe&rsquo;s army&mdash;ten thousand
      uniforms, eleven hundred fur overcoats, eleven thousand blankets, besides
      a battery or two of field guns and six hundred cavalry equipments. You did
      us a timely service, Captain Jones. Many an American soldier was the
      warmer last winter, because of the <i>Mellish</i> and the <i>Bideford</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; says Captain Paul Jones, not without confusion, &ldquo;to learn
      that I so much pleased you. It gives me courage to hope that you will come
      to my shoulder against Mr. Adams and his pet incompetent, Saltonstall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Washington again dons his manner of grave inscrutability, and
      falls to his habit of striding up and down, hands locked beneath the
      buff-and-blue flaps of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jones,&rdquo; he suddenly breaks forth, &ldquo;you are a sailor: What do you
      do afloat in case of a head wind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A head wind?&rdquo; repeats Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;Why, sir, if it&rsquo;s no more than
      just a gale, I fall to tacking, sta&rsquo;board and port. If it should be aught
      of a hurricane, now, I&rsquo;d set a storm stays&rsquo;l, heave to, and wait for
      weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; returns the General, soberly. &ldquo;Well, Captain Jones, one may
      find headwinds ashore as well as afloat. Now, in the matter of the <i>Trumbull</i>,
      I should advise you to &lsquo;heave to,&rsquo; as you say, &lsquo;and wait for weather.&rsquo; Mr.
      Adams insists on Captain Saltonstall; and it is not alone inconvenient,
      it&rsquo;s impossible, with the Marine Committee made up as it is, to oppose
      him. Be patient, and you shall not in the end fare worse than your
      deserts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones wheels on Mr. Morris, who, with Lafayette, has kept
      silence, while giving interested ear to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, Mr. Morris?&rdquo; observes Captain Paul Jones, manner dogged and
      aggressive. &ldquo;As I warned you in my letter, I shall now prefer charges
      against Captain Saltonstall&mdash;charge him with flat cowardice while in
      command of the <i>Alfred</i>, and demand a court-martial. Under the
      circumstances, I deem it my public duty so to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morris makes a gesture of dissent and repressive protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Captain,&rdquo; expostulates Mr. Morris, his manner pleading, yet full
      of authority; precisely the manner of one who deals with a trained tiger
      which he is willing to coax, while firmly intending to control&mdash;&ldquo;my
      dear Captain, hear reason! Your charges would be suppressed&mdash;pigeon-holed!
      The influence of Mr. Adams with the Marine Committee is supreme. It could,
      let me tell you, accomplish much more than merely silence your charges. It
      could go further, and force a resolution of confidence in Captain
      Salton-stall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; retorts Captain Paul Jones, inveterate as iron, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still a shot
      in my locker. I shall publish his cowardice over my own name; I shall
      placard every street corner; for I think the American people entitled to
      know the sort of servant they have had in Captain Saltonstall. They shall
      not risk a good ship and a brave crew, with a coward in the dark; and so I
      tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jones,&rdquo; observes General Washington, who, cool and unruffled, is
      a contrast to the disturbed Mr. Morris, &ldquo;Captain Jones, as a gentleman,
      you realize what would be the result of a public charge of cowardice
      against Captain Saltonstall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would challenge you instantly!&rdquo; breaks in Mr. Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo; says Captain Paul Jones, with just the preliminary glimmer of
      battle in his hard brown eyes. &ldquo;As you say, sir, he would challenge me.
      And having challenged me, I should take pleasure in doing my best to kill
      him. I got a pair of Galway duelling pistols out of the <i>Bideford</i>;
      they were coming to Lord Howe. If I can lure Captain Saltonstall to the
      field, it shall go hard, but with one of those Irish sawhandles I rid the
      American navy of him. Once I have him at ten paces, it will take something
      more than the influence of Mr. Adams to bring him safely off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morris&rsquo; brow colors; General Washington takes the situation more at
      ease. He even gives way briefly to a shadowy smile; for the great patriot,
      while not so inflammable, is quite as combative as any Captain Paul Jones
      of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken advice on this?&rdquo; asks General Washington, following a
      pause, during which everybody has had time to more or less digest Captain
      Paul Jones&rsquo; unique plan for improving the American navy. &ldquo;I do not suppose
      you have gone to this decision without counsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir; I am, as you know, both prudent and conservative&mdash;no one more
      so. Certainly, I&rsquo;ve taken counsel. I went to General Cadwalader; he
      expresses himself as in hearty accord with me. Indeed, it is understood
      between us that he shall act for me in any affair I may have with Captain
      Saltonstall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of General Cadwalader, General Washington smiles openly,
      while Mr. Morris groans and throws up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! Cadwalader!&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Morris, when he can command his
      tongue. &ldquo;The worst firebrand in the country! Cadwalader, forsooth! who has
      ever had but one word of advice for every man&mdash;&lsquo;Fight!&rsquo;&rdquo; Then,
      abruptly descending upon Captain Paul Jones with all the authority of a
      father addressing a favorite but rebellious son: &ldquo;Paul; listen! You
      believe me your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indubitably! I have no better friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me tell you, Paul: In the name of that friendship this thing
      must end&mdash;absolutely end. If you&rsquo;ve drawn up any accusation of
      cowardice against Captain Saltonstall, you must burn it and forget the
      whole affair. You must dismiss this subject from your mind. In Cadwalader
      you have invited the wrong kind of advice. I now give you the right kind.
      The General will tell you so; your friend, the Marquis, will tell you so.
      And forasmuch as you value my friendship you must obey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morris in his earnestness lays a paternal hand on the shoulder of
      Captain Paul Jones, his manner a composite of coax and command. Before the
      latter, who is visibly shaken by the friendly determination of Mr. Morris,
      can frame reply, Lafayette&mdash;who has been scrupulous to maintain a
      polite silence from first to last&mdash;interferes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our good friend, Mr. Morris,&rdquo; interjects Lafayette, &ldquo;has been so generous
      as to refer to me. I could not have said a word without; since what you
      discuss is private and personal to yourselves as Americans, and of a
      character that forbids me, a Frenchman and an alien even though a friend,
      voicing my views. However, since Mr. Morris has so complimented me as to
      make his appeal in my name, I must&mdash;in all respect and friendship for
      Captain Jones, whom I admire&mdash;unite my voice with his. The more
      readily since I can take it upon myself to promise Captain Jones that if
      he will cross to France, with a letter I shall give him to my king, a
      fighting ship of frigate strength shall be his within the month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concludes, Lafayette, a blush reddening his cheek&mdash;for he is
      only a boy&mdash;extends two hands to Captain Paul Jones as though,
      fearful of having said too much, he would mutely apologize. Captain Paul
      Jones seizes the hands with a warmth equal to the other&rsquo;s; and the
      incident, capping as it does the fatherly opposition of Mr. Morris, puts
      an end to that beautiful plan, so full of dire promise for Captain
      Saltonstall, which in their mutual belligerencies Captain Paul Jones and
      the fire-fed Cadwalader have formulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that you will go to France, my friend!&rdquo; urges the impulsive young
      Frenchman; &ldquo;say that you will go! I will exhaust Auvergne, and all of
      France besides, but you shall have the promised ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, General Washington interferes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forbear, my dear Marquis!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Captain Jones shall go to France.
      But he shall go with an American crew, in an American ship, flying the
      American flag.&rdquo; Then, to Captain Paul Jones: &ldquo;Do me the honor, Captain, to
      hold yourself in readiness to obey any summons I may send. Believe me, I
      shall count myself as one without influence, if you do not hear from me
      within the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let us glance ahead two years for the final word of Captain Saltonstall.
      Captain Paul Jones, with his hard-won prize, the crippled <i>Serapis</i>,
      creeps into the Texel, and the earliest story wherewith the Dutch regale
      him is how Captain Saltonstall, weak, forceless, incompetent, has
      surrendered the new, thirty-two-gun frigate, <i>Warren</i>, to the English
      in Penobscot Bay. Captain Paul Jones hears the disgraceful news with set
      and angry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just learned the miserable fate of the <i>Warren</i>,&rdquo; he writes
      to Mr. Morris; &ldquo;and hearing it I reproach myself. If I had obeyed the
      dictates of my sense of duty on a Philadelphia day you will recall,
      instead of yielding to the persuasions of the peacemakers, our flag might
      still be flying on the <i>Warren!</i>&rdquo;

      listless waiting go by, and Captain Paul Jones again finds himself and Mr.
      Morris closeted with General Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jones,&rdquo; says the latter, speaking with a kindly gravity, &ldquo;Mr.
      Morris and I have so pushed your affairs with the Marine Committee that
      to-morrow Congress will pass a double resolution, adopting a new flag, the
      stars and stripes, and appointing you to command the <i>Ranger</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ranger!&rdquo; exclaims Captain Paul Jones, beginning to glow. &ldquo;Thanks,
      General; a thousand thanks! And to you also, Mr. Morris, whom I shall
      never forget! The Ranger! I know her! She is being sparred and rigged at
      Portsmouth! New, three hundred tons; a beauty, too, they tell me!
      Gentlemen, I am off at once to Portsmouth! I must see to stepping her
      masts and mounting her batteries myself.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jones,&rdquo; interrupts the General, laying a large detaining hand on
      the other&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;you will go to Portsmouth and look after your ship.
      Also, while your destination is France, you must wait for orders to sail.
      I may have weighty despatches for the French King&mdash;news that will
      shake Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      June is as cool in Portsmouth as it is in Philadelphia. Cooler; for the
      New Hampshire breeze has in it the chill smell of those snows that lie
      unmelted in the mountains. Captain Paul Jones comes unannounced, eyes
      dancing like those of a child with a new toy, and seeks the wharf where
      the __Ranger__ is being fitted to her spars. From a convenient coign he
      looks the <i>Ranger</i> over, and evinces a master&rsquo;s appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nose sharp! Plenty of dead-rise! Lean lines!&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;With the wind
      anywhere abaft the beam, she should race like a greyhound! All, she&rsquo;s a
      beauty, fit to warm the cockles of a sailor&rsquo;s heart! See to the sheer of
      her!&mdash;as delicate as the lines of a woman&rsquo;s arm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up comes a sturdy figure with an air of command, an officer&rsquo;s hat on his
      head, a ship-carpenter&rsquo;s adz in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Captain Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Paul Jones, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for not first giving my name. I&rsquo;m Elijah Hall, who is to sail
      second officer with you in yon <i>Ranger</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones and Lieutenant Hall fall into instant and profound
      confab of a deeply nautical complexion, a confab quite beyond a landsman&rsquo;s
      comprehension, wherein such phrases as &ldquo;flush-decks,&rdquo; &ldquo;short poop-deck,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;bilges,&rdquo; &ldquo;futtocks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knees&rdquo; abound, and are reeled off as though
      their use gives our two ship-enthusiasts unbridled satisfaction. At last
      Lieutenant Hall remarks, pointing to three long sticks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;re her masts, sir. They were taken out of a four-hundred-ton
      Indiaman, and are too long for a three-hundred-ton ship like the <i>Ranger</i>.
      I was thinking I&rsquo;d cut&rsquo;em off four feet in the caps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a sin!&rdquo; exclaims Captain Paul Jones, voice almost religious
      in its fervent zeal. &ldquo;Three as fine pieces of pine as ever came out of
      Norway, too! I&rsquo;d be afraid to cut&rsquo;em, Mr. Hall; it would give the ship bad
      luck. I&rsquo;ll tell you what! Fid them four feet lower in the hounds; it will
      amount to the same thing, and at the same time save the sticks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones goes at the congenial task of fitting out the <i>Ranger</i>
      with his usual day-and-night energy. When he finds her over-sparred, with
      her masts too long, he still refuses to cut them down, but shortens yard
      and bowsprit, jib-boom and spankerboom. He doesn&rsquo;t like the Marine
      Committee&rsquo;s armament of twenty six-pounders, and proceeds to mount four
      six-pounders and fourteen long nines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One nine-pounder is equal to two six-pounders,&rdquo; says Captain Paul Jones;
      &ldquo;and, since it&rsquo;s I who must put to sea in the <i>Ranger</i>, and not the
      Marine Committee, nine-ponnders I&rsquo;ll have, and say no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The New Hampshire girls, on the Fourth of July, come down to the <i>Ranger</i>,
      and present Captain Paul Jones a flag&mdash;red, white, and blue&mdash;quilted
      of cloth ravished from their virgin petticoats. The gallant mariner makes
      the New Hampshire girls a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0143.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That flag,&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;that flag and I, as captain of the <i>Ranger</i>,
      were born on the same day. We are twins. We shall not be parted life or
      death; we shall float together or sink together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These brave words, in the long run, find amendment. The petticoat flag of
      the pretty New Hampshire girls is the flag which, two years later, flies
      from the <i>Richard&rsquo;s</i> indomitable peak when Captain Paul Jones cuts
      down the gallant Pierson and his <i>Serapis</i>. After that fight off
      Scarborough Head, Captain Paul Jones writes to the pretty New Hampshire
      girls&mdash;for he ever remembers the ladies&mdash;recounting the last
      destiny of their petticoat ensign. He is telling of the <i>Richard&rsquo;s</i>
      death throes, as viewed from the blood-slippery decks of the conquered <i>Serapis</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one was now left aboard the Richard but my dead. To them I gave the
      good old ship to be their coffin; in her they found a sublime sepulcher.
      She rolled heavily in the swell, her gun-deck awash to the port-sills,
      settled slowly by the head, and sank from sight. The ensign gaff, shot
      away in the action, had been fished and put in place; and there your flag
      was left flying when we abandoned her. As she went down by the head, her
      taffrail rose for a moment; and so the last that mortal eye ever saw of
      the gallant <i>Richard</i> was your unconquered ensign. I couldn&rsquo;t strip
      it from the brave old ship in her last agony; nor could I deny my dead on
      her decks, who had given their lives to keep it flying, the glory of
      taking it with them. And so I parted with it; so they took it for their
      winding sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the <i>Ranger</i> is ready for sea; and still those belated
      despatches from General Washington for the French King do not come. One
      cold October day a horseman, worn and haggard, rides into Portsmouth.
      Stained, dust-caked, reeling in his saddle, he calls for Captain Paul
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; responds that gentleman. &ldquo;What would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from General Washington,&rdquo; cries the man. &ldquo;Burgoyne has
      surrendered! Here are your despatches for France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones takes the packet, stunned for the moment by the mighty
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for food and drink,&rdquo; says the man faintly, as with difficulty he
      slips to the ground. &ldquo;One hundred and eighty miles have I rode in thirty
      hours. It was the brave news kept me going; the thought of those beaten
      English held me up like wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and eighty miles!&rdquo; cries Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;Thirty hours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man points to his mount, where it stands with drooping head and
      quivering flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the tenth I&rsquo;ve had. Horse flesh and hard riding did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes after the despatches are put in his hands, Captain Paul Jones
      is aboard the <i>Ranger</i>. Then comes the tramp of forty feet about the
      capstan. Twenty powerful breasts are pressed against the capstan bars, and
      the <i>Ranger</i> is walked up to its anchors, while aloft the brisk
      top-men are shaking out the sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchor up and down, sir!&rdquo; reports Boatswain Jack Robinson, who has left
      his Polly at home, while he sails with the <i>Ranger</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchor up and down!&rdquo; repeats Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;Bring her home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a &ldquo;Heave ho!&rdquo; the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s anchors are pulled out of
      Portsmouth sands. Captain Paul Jones himself takes the wheel and pays off
      its head before the breeze, already bellying the foresails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her every stitch you have, Mr. Hall,&rdquo; says Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;We
      must be clear of the Isles of Shoals by daybreak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asks Lieutenant Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East, by south, half east! And Mr. Hall, day and night, blow high, blow
      low, spread every rag you&rsquo;ve got. Burgoyne has surrendered. Either I shall
      tear the sticks out of the <i>Ranger</i>, or spread that news in France in
      thirty days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More haste, less speed!&rdquo; murmurs the prudent Lieutenant Hall; and so,
      having eased his mind like a true seaman, he goes forward heatedly to
      spread sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top-heavy little <i>Ranger</i>, with her acre of canvas, heels over
      until, with decks awash, she glides eastward like a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pipe all hands aft, Mr. Bo&rsquo;sen!&rdquo; commands Captain Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatswain Jack Robinson puts his whistle to his lips, and sends a shrill
      call singing through the ship. The crew come scampering aft; all save a
      contingent aloft, who race down by the backstays, claw under claw, as
      might so many cats. Some of our old friends of the <i>Providence</i> are
      there&mdash;the aquatic Scipio and Cato, with the little red Indian
      port-fire, Anthony Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men,&rdquo; cries Captain Paul Jones, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re off for France. We shall meet
      nasty weather, for it&rsquo;s the beginning of winter, and I shall steer the
      northern course. It is to be a case of crack-on canvas, foul weather or
      fair: and, since the ship is oversparred and cranky, we must mind her day
      and night. To make all safe, the watch shall be lap-watched, so as to keep
      plenty of hands on deck. This will double your work, but I shall also
      double your grog. Now, my hearties, let every man among you do his duty by
      flag and ship. Burgoyne has surrendered, and it&rsquo;s for us to carry the word
      to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shipmates,&rdquo; observes Boatswain Jack Robinson, judgmatically, as the hands
      go tumbling forward, &ldquo;shipmates, the old <i>Ranger</i> is a damned
      comfortable ship. &lsquo;Double watches, double work!&rsquo; says the skipper; but
      also &lsquo;Double grog!&rsquo; says he. Wherefore, I says again, the old <i>Ranger</i>
      is a damned comfortable ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eight bells now, breakfast; and the Isles of Shoals are vanishing over the
      <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s stern. Suddenly a boyish voice strikes up:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;So now we had him hard and fast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Burgoyne laid down his arms at last,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And that is why we brave the blast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To carry the news to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones pauses in his short quarterdeck walk, cocks his ear,
      and listens. The hoarse crew take up the chorus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Heigh ho! carry the news!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Go carry the news to London,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tell old King George how he&rsquo;s undone.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh, ho! carry the news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatswain Jack Robinson, observing Captain Paul Jones listening, becomes
      explanatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a bit of a ditty, Cap&rsquo;n; the same composed by Midshipman Hill, d&rsquo;ye
      see, in honor of this here cruise. A right good ballid, too, I calls it;
      and amazin&rsquo; fine for a lad of twenty, who hardly knows a reef-point from a
      gasket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vouchsafing this, Boatswain Jack Robinson rolls forward with walrus gait,
      chanting as he goes in a voice tuned by storms and broken across capstan
      bars, the hoarse refrain:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh, ho! carry the news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the good ship <i>Ranger</i> plows eastward on her course. Eighteen
      hours out of twenty-four, Captain Paul Jones holds the deck. In the end he
      has his reward. Just thirty days after the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s anchors kissed
      the Portsmouth sands good-by, they go splashing into the dull waters of
      the Loire.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;HOW THE &ldquo;RANGER&rdquo; TOOK THE &ldquo;DRAKE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>our months slip
      by; it is April, and the idle <i>Ranger</i> rides in the harbor of Brest.
      Morose, sore with inactivity, Captain Paul Jones seeks out Doctor Franklin
      at the philosopher&rsquo;s house in Passy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lying by rusts me,&rdquo; Captain Paul Jones is saying as he and Doctor
      Franklin have a turn in the garden. The latter likes the thin French
      sunshine, and gets as much of it as he may. &ldquo;Yes, it rusts me&mdash;fills
      me with despair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do, then?&rdquo; asks Doctor Franklin, his coarse, shrewd face
      quickening into interest. &ldquo;Have you a cruise mapped out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I thought, if you&rsquo;ve no objections, I&rsquo;d just poke the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s
      nose into the Irish Sea, and take a look at Whitehaven. You know I was
      born by the Solway, and the coast I speak of is an old acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no objection, Captain, save the smallness of your ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is easily answered; for I give you my word, Doctor, the little <i>Ranger</i>
      can sail round any English ship on the home station. I shall be safe, no
      fear; for what I can&rsquo;t whip I can run from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you spoken to my brother commissioners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin looks up, a grim, expectant twinkle in his gray eyes.
      Captain Paul Jones cracks his fingers in angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Doctor, if I&rsquo;m frank to the frontiers of rudeness. Of what
      avail to speak to Mr. Dean, who is asleep? Of what avail to speak to Mr.
      Lee, who surrounds himself with British spies like that creature Thornton,
      his private secretary? I ask you plain questions, Doctor, for I know you
      to be a practical man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher grins knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not speak of British spies to Commissioner Lee, Captain Jones.
      My task in France is enough difficult as it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on that account, Doctor, and on that alone, I have so far refrained
      from saying aught to Mr. Lee. But I tell you I misdoubt the man. His
      fellow Thornton I know to be in daily communication with the English
      admiralty! he clinks English gold in his pockets as the wage of his
      treason. This, were there no one save myself to consider, I should say in
      the face of Arthur Lee; ay! for that matter in the face of all the Lees
      that ever hailed from Virginia. I tell you this, Doctor, for your own
      guidance.&rdquo; Then, following a pause: &ldquo;Not that it sets politely with my
      years to go cautioning one so much my superior in age, wisdom and
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher glances up from the violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly, Captain Jones, I have already given myself that caution.
      However, concerning your proposed cruise: I shall leave all to your
      judgment. Certainly, our warships, as you say, were meant for battle-work,
      and not to waste their lives junketing about French ports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing, doctor,&rdquo; observes Captain Paul Jones, at parting: &ldquo;Tell your
      fellow commissioners that I&rsquo;ve cleared for the west coast of Ireland, with
      a purpose to go north-about around the British islands. If you let them
      hear I&rsquo;m off for Whitehaven, I give you my honor that, with the spy
      Thornton selling my blood to the English admiralty, I shall have the whole
      British fleet at my heels before I reach St. George&rsquo;s Channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones, in command of the <i>Ranger</i>, drops in at
      Whitehaven. With twenty-nine of his lads he goes ashore of a dripping
      morning, pens up the sleepy garrisons of the two forts, and spikes their
      guns. Then, having spikes to spare, he makes useless a shore battery,
      while the ballad-mongering Midshipman Hill, with six men, chases inland
      one hundred coast guardsmen and militia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones, waxing industrious, attempts to burn the shipping
      which crowds the tidal basin at Whitehaven. In these fire-lighting efforts
      he succeeds to the extent of five ships; after which he rows out to the <i>Ranger</i>.
      Thereupon the people and militia, who crowd the terror-smitten hills round
      about, come down into their town again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones crosses now to the north shore of the Solway for a
      morning call upon the Earl of Selkirk. He schemes to capture that
      patrician, and trade him back to the English for certain good American
      sailors whom they hold as prisoners. The plan falls through, since the
      noble earl is not at home. In lieu, the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s crew take unto
      themselves the Selkirk plate, which Captain Paul Jones subsequently buys
      from them, paying the ransom from his own purse, and returns with his
      compliments gallantly expressed in a letter to the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Solway, the little <i>Ranger</i> stands west by north across the
      Irish Sea. Off Carrickfergus she finds the <i>Drake</i>, an English sloop
      of war that is two long nines the better than the <i>Ranger</i> in her
      broadsides, and thirty-one men stronger in her crew. To save trouble, the
      <i>Ranger</i> is hove to off the mouth of Belfast Lough, and waits for the
      <i>Drake</i> to come out. This the English ship does slowly and with
      difficulty, being on the wrong side of wind and tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun is no more than an hour high,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Story of Paul Jones suggests Lieutenant Wallingford wistfully.
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we go to meet them, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones shakes his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve better water here,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Besides, the moon will be big; we&rsquo;ll
      fight them by the light of the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, reluctantly, the <i>Drake</i> forges within hail. She is in doubt
      about the <i>Ranger</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; cries the <i>Drake</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones puts his speaking-trumpet to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American ship <i>Ranger</i>,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;Come on; we&rsquo;re waiting for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further parley, broadside answers broadside and the battle is on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both ships head north, the <i>Ranger</i> having the weather-gage. This
      last gives Captain Paul Jones the nautical upperhand. In ship-fighting,
      the weather-gage is equivalent to an underhold in wrestling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a swell on, and the two ships roll heavily. They shape their
      course side by side, keeping within musket-reach of each other. The breeze
      is on the starboard quarter, and a little faster than the ships. By this
      good luck, the smoke of the broadsides is sent drifting ahead, and the
      line of sight between the ships kept free. On they crawl, broadside
      talking to broadside; only the Americans are smarter with their guns, and
      fire three to the <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight now invests the scene in gray, as the sun sinks behind the close,
      dark Irish headlands to the west. Night, cloudless and serene, comes down;
      the round, full moon shines out, and its mild rays mingle and merge with
      the angry glare of the battle-lanterns. Captain Paul Jones from his narrow
      quarterdeck watches the Drake through his night glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Very good!&rdquo; he murmurs, as the <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s foremast is
      splintered by a round shot. Then, to the Salem man who has the wheel:
      &ldquo;Bring us a little closer, Mr. Sargent; a little closer in, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones again rivets his glass upon the <i>Drake</i>. An
      exclamation escapes him. It comes upon him that his gunners are having
      advantage of the roll of the ships, and time their broadsides so as to
      catch the <i>Drake</i> as, reeling to port, she brings up her starboard
      side. By this plausible manouvre, those sagacious ones who train the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s
      guns are sending shot after shot through and through the <i>Drake</i>,
      between wind and water, half of them indeed below the water-line. Captain
      Paul Jones, through his glass, makes out the black round shot-holes; they
      show as thick as cloves in the rind of a Christmas ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t match my book! I must put a stopper on
      such work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shutting up his glass, Captain Paul Jones leaps from the after flush-deck
      down among his sailors. Drunk with blood, grimed of powder, naked to the
      waist, the black glory of battle in their hearts, they merrily work their
      guns. It is as he beheld from the after-deck. The <i>Ranger</i> rolls to
      port as the <i>Drake</i>, all dripping, is fetching up her starboard side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; cries the master-gunner, and &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; runs the word along the
      battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long nines respond with flame and bellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they race crashingly inboard with the recoil, and are caught by the
      breeching tackle. With that the smoky work is all to do over again. The
      brawny sailor men&mdash;from Nantucket, from Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, from Sag
      Harbor, from New London and Barnstable and Salem and Boston and Portsmouth
      they are&mdash;shirtless and shoeless, barefoot and stripped to the belts,
      ply sponge and rammer. Again each black-throated gun is ready with a
      stomachful of solid shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show &lsquo;em your teeth, mates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guns rattle forward on their carriages. The quick port-tires stand
      ready, blowing their matches. There is a brief pause, as the master-gunner
      waits for that fatal downward roll to port which offers and opens the <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s
      starboard side almost to the keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I see, Mr. Starbuck,&rdquo; begins Captain Paul Jones sweetly, addressing
      the master-gunner. &ldquo;Your effort is to hull the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; cries the master-gunner, for just then the <i>Ranger</i> is
      reeling down to port, while the <i>Drake</i> is coming up to starboard,
      and he must not waste the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long nines roar cheerfully, spouting fire and smoke. Then comes that
      crashing inboard leap, to be caught up short by the tackle. Again the
      sponges; again the rammers; with the busy shot-handlers working in
      between. And all the while the little powder monkeys, lads of eleven and
      twelve, go pattering to and fro, with cartridges from the magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir!&rdquo; responds the master-gunner, now finding time to reply to
      the comment of Captain Paul Jones; &ldquo;as you says, we&rsquo;re trying to hull her,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones makes out three new holes below the Brake&rsquo;s
      plankslieer, the hopeful harvest of that last broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; demands Captain Paul Jones, who as a mere first effect of
      battle never fails of a rippling amiability, &ldquo;may I ask, Mr. Starbuck,
      your design in thus aiming below the water-line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saving you presence, Captain, we designs to sink the bitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! That is what I surmised! To a quick seaman like yourself, Mr.
      Starbuck, a word will do. I don&rsquo;t want her sunk, d&rsquo;ye see! I want to bring
      her into France as an object-lesson, and show the Frenchmen what Americans
      can do. Under the circumstances, Mr. Starbnck, I shall be obliged if you
      let her hull alone. It will take Mr. Hitchburn, our carpenter, a week as
      it is &ldquo;&mdash;this comes off reproachfully&mdash;&ldquo;to stop the holes you&rsquo;ve
      already made. And so, Mr. Starbnck, from now on comb her decks and cut her
      up in the spars as much as ever you like; but please keep off her hull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; says the master-gunner, saluting. Then: &ldquo;Pass the word that
      we&rsquo;re to leave her hull alone. Cap&rsquo;n has set his heart on catching her
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the plan of attack finds reversal, the <i>Ranger</i> firing as
      she comes up to port and when only a narrow streak of the Drake&rsquo;s
      starboard beam is visible above the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones remains among the sailors, canvassing in a gratified
      way the results of this change. While thus engaged, port-fire Anthony
      Jeremiah grins up at him, meanwhile blowing his match to keep it lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You enjoy yourself, I see, Jerry,&rdquo; remarks Captain Paul Jones, who, as
      observed, is never so affable as when guns are crashing, blood is flowing,
      and splinters flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me like to hear the big guns talk, Captain,&rdquo; responds the Indian. &ldquo;It
      gives Jerry a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones again swings his glass on the Drake. He is just in time
      to see her fore and main topsail-yards come down onto the caps by the run.
      The last broadside does that. In an instant, he is running aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with your helm, Mr. Sargent!&rdquo; he roars. &ldquo;Pull her down for every
      ounce that&rsquo;s in you, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quartermaster Sargent, thus encouraged, climbs the wheel like a squirrel;
      the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s topsails shiver; then, yielding to her helm, she
      slowly luffs across the helpless stern of the Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboard with those sta&rsquo;board tacks!&rdquo; shouts Captain Paul Jones. Then,
      turning again to the wheelman: &ldquo;Steady, Mr. Sargent; keep her full!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a skurry across the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s decks, as the men rush from
      the port to the starboard battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by, Mr. Starbuck,&rdquo; calls ont Captain Paul Jones, &ldquo;to rake her as we
      cross her stern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; returns the master-gunner. &ldquo;She shall have it for&rsquo;ard and
      aft, as my old gran&rsquo;am shells peas cods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Mr. Sargent!&rdquo; and again Captain Paul Jones cautions the alert
      wheelman. &ldquo;Keep her as she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guns are swung, and depressed so as to tear the poor <i>Drake</i> open
      from stern-post to cutwater at one discharge. The <i>Ranger</i> gathers
      head; slowly she makes ready to cross her enemy&rsquo;s stern so close that one
      might chuck a biscuit aboard. It is a moment fraught of life and death for
      the unhappy <i>Drake</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her captain and first officer already dead, the situation proves
      beyond the second officer, on whom the responsibility of fighting or
      surrendering the ship devolves. His sullen British soul gives way; and he
      strikes his colors just in time to avoid that raking fire which would else
      have snuffed him off the face of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out-fought, out-manoeuvred, and out-sailed!&rdquo; exclaims Captain Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Hall, flushed of combat, comes up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have beaten them, Captain!&rdquo; exults Lieutenant Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done more than that, Mr. Hall,&rdquo; responds Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;We
      have defeated an aphorism, and made a precedent. For the first time in the
      history of the sea, a lighter ship, with a smaller crew and a weaker
      battery, has whipped an Englishman.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE DUCHESS OF CHARTRES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is a notable
      gathering that assembles at Doctor Franklin&rsquo;s house in Passy. Mr. Adams
      and his wife have just arrived, and the doctor presents them to Madame
      Brillon and Madame Houdetot, already there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Adams is but recently come from America,&rdquo; the doctor whispers. &ldquo;He
      takes Mr. Dean&rsquo;s place as a member of our commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Houdetot talks with Mrs. Adams; and because of her bad English and
      the other&rsquo;s bad French they get on badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lee sends his compliments,&rdquo; observes Mr. Adams, loftily, to Doctor
      Franklin, &ldquo;and regrets that he cannot come. He heard, I understand, that
      Captain Paul Jones is to be here, and does not care to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; responds the doctor, evincing scanty concern at the failure of Mr.
      Lee to come. &ldquo;Now I do not wonder! I hear that Captain Jones thrashed Mr.
      Lee&rsquo;s secretary in a tavern at Nantes, and our proud Mr. Lee, I suppose,
      resents it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrashed him!&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Adams, in high tones; &ldquo;Captain Jones seized a
      stick and beat him like a dog, applying to him the while such epithets as
      &lsquo;liar!&rsquo; and &lsquo;spy.&rsquo; Mr. Lee&rsquo;s secretary has left France through fear of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The portly doctor lifts his hands at this; but underneath his deprecatory
      horror, hides a complacency, a satisfaction, as though the violence of
      Captain Jones will not leave him utterly unstrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fights everybody,&rdquo; says the good doctor, resignedly; &ldquo;on land as well
      as on sea. Nor can I teach him the difference between his own personal
      enemies, and the enemies of his country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems a bit unruly,&rdquo; observes the pompous Mr. Adams; &ldquo;a bit unruly,
      does this Captain Jones of yours. I&rsquo;m told he sold the <i>Drake</i>, and
      what other ships were captured on his recent cruise, in the most
      high-handed, masterful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else was he to do? When a road becomes impassable, what is your
      course? You push down a panel of fence and go cross-lots. Captain Jones
      had two hundred prisoners to feed, besides his own brave crew of one
      hundred and eighteen. We had no money to give him. Were they to starve?
      I&rsquo;m not surprised that he sold the ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that the Frenchmen bought them,&rdquo; returns Mr. Adams.
      &ldquo;Captain Jones could give no title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin&rsquo;s keen eyes twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could give possession, Mr. Adams. And let me tell you that in France,
      as everywhere else, possession is nine parts of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Brillon draws Mr. Adams aside, while Doctor Franklin welcomes the
      beautiful royal girl&mdash;the Duchess de Chartres; to whom he later
      presents Mr. Adams and Mrs. Adams. Madame Houdetot leaves Mrs. Adams with
      the girl-Duchess and talks aside with Doctor Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she whispers, with an eye on the girlish Duchess, &ldquo;that
      you received calls from royalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchess de Chartres has been with her great relative, the king, upon
      the business of Captain Jones. She comes to meet the captain, whom we
      every moment expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in love with him!&mdash;madly in love with him!&rdquo; says Madame
      Houdetot. &ldquo;All the world knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, who at seventy-two is a distinguished gallant, smiles
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not once tell you that Captain Jones, the invincible among men, is
      the irresistible among women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort, I think. But you have heard of the duchess and
      your irresistible, invincible one, had you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam, I am a diplomat,&rdquo; replies the doctor, slyly. &ldquo;And it is an
      infraction of the laws of diplomacy to tell what you hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been very tender at the duchess&rsquo;s summer house near Brest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the husband&mdash;the Duke de Chartres!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most excellent gentleman! A most admirable husband of most
      unimpeachable domestic manners! Believe me, I cannot laud him too highly!
      Every husband in Prance should copy him! He honors his wife, and&mdash;stays
      aboard his ship, the <i>Saint Esprit</i>.&rdquo; After a pause the gossipy
      Madame Houdetot continues: &ldquo;No doubt the duke considers his wife&rsquo;s rank.
      Is the great-granddaughter of the Grande Louis to be held within those
      narrow lines that confine the feet of other women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Mr. Adams?&rdquo; asks Madame Brillon, coming up. &ldquo;Is he a great
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin glances across where the austere Mr. Adams is stiffly
      posing, with a final thought of impressing the sparkling Duchess de
      Chartres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather he is a <i>big</i> man,&rdquo; replies the philosopher. &ldquo;Like some
      houses, his foundations cover a deal of ground; but then he is only one
      story high. If you could raise Mr. Adams another story, he would be a <i>great</i>
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good doctor goes over, and becomes polite to Mrs. Adams; for the
      enlightenment of that lady of reserve and dignity, he expands on France
      and the French character. Suddenly the door is thrown open, and all
      unannounced a queer figure rushes in. She is clad in rumpled muslin and
      soiled lutestring. Her hair is frizzed, her face painted, her cap awry,
      and she is fair and fat and of middle years. This remarkable apparition
      embraces Doctor Franklin, kisses him resoundingly, first on the left cheek
      then on the right, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My flame!&mdash;my love!&mdash;my Franklin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seasoned doctor receives this caressing broadside steadily, while the
      desolated Mrs. Adams sits round-eyed and stony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the eccentric Madame Helvetius,&rdquo; explains Madame Brillon in a low
      tone to Mrs. Adams. &ldquo;They call her the &lsquo;Rich Widow of Passy.&rsquo; She and the
      good doctor are dearest friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eccentric!&rdquo; Mrs. Adams perceives as much, and says so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin returns to Mrs. Adams, whom he suspects of being hungry
      for an explanation, while the buoyant Madame Helvetius, as one sure of her
      impregnable position, wanders confidently about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should become acquainted with Madame Helvetius,&rdquo; submits the doctor
      pleasantly. &ldquo;Wise, generous, afire for our cause&mdash;you would dote on
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adams icily fears not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me; you would!&rdquo; insists the doctor. &ldquo;True! her manners are of her
      people and her region. They are not those of Puritan New England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adams interrupts to say that she has never before heard so much said
      in favor of Puritan New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, my dear Mrs. Adams,&rdquo; goes on the good doctor, as one determined
      to conquer for Madame Helvetius the other&rsquo;s favorable opinion, &ldquo;you would
      do wrong to apply a New England judgment to our friend. Her exuberance is
      of the surface.&rdquo; Then, quizzically: &ldquo;A mere manner, I assure you, and
      counts for no more than should what she is doing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adams lifts her severe gaze at this to Madame Helvetius. That amiable
      French woman is in rapt and closest converse with Mr. Adams, hand on his
      shoulder, her widowed lips to his ear. Mr. Adams is standing as one
      frozen, casting ever and anon a furtive glance, like an alarmed sheep, at
      Mrs. Adams. For an arctic moment, Mrs. Adams is held by the terrors of
      that spectacle; then she moves to her husband&rsquo;s rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Helvetius comes presently to Doctor Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an iceberg!&rdquo; she remarks, with a toss of the frizzed head towards
      Mr. Adams. &ldquo;Does he ever thaw!&rdquo; Then, as her glance takes in Mrs. Adams:
      &ldquo;Poor man! He might be August, missing her. It is she who congeals him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now he, for whom they wait, is announced&mdash;Captain Paul Jones. He
      has about him everything of the <i>salon</i> and nothing of the sea. His
      amiable yet polished good breeding wins on Mrs. Adams, and even the
      repellant wintry Mr. Adams is rendered urbane. Captain Paul Jones becomes
      the instant centre of the little assemblage. And yet, even while he gives
      his words to the others, his glances rove softly to the girl-Duchess, who
      stands apart, as might one who for a space&mdash;only for a space&mdash;permits
      room to others. The girl-Duchess is polite; she grants him what time is
      required to offer his greetings all around. Then, in the most open,
      obvious way, as though none might criticise or gainsay her conduct, she
      draws him into a secluded corner. They make a rare study, these two; he
      deferential yet dominant, she proud but yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the king?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him? Am I not, too, a Bourbon?&rdquo; This comes off with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely! Of course you saw him!&rdquo; responds Captain Paul Jones, recalling
      his manner to one of easy matter-of-fact. &ldquo;Your royal highness will pardon
      my inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess objects petulantly to the &ldquo;Royal Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From you I do not like it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;From you&rdquo;&mdash;and here comes a
      flood of softness, while her black eyes shine like strange jewels&mdash;&ldquo;from
      you, as you know, my friend, I would have only those titles that,
      arm-encircled, heart to heart, a man gives to the one woman of his sou&rsquo;s
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sinks at the close, while her eyes leave his for the floor. His
      presence is like a gale, and she bends before him as the willow bends
      before the strong wind. Meanwhile, as instructive to Mr. Adams, the loud
      Doctor is saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; you must have a wig. No one sees the king without a wig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked an hour&mdash;the king and I,&rdquo; goes on the girl-Duchess,
      recovering herself. &ldquo;I read him your letter; he was vastly interested.
      Then I told him how the <i>Ranger</i> had been called to America. Also I
      drew him pictures of what you had done; and how bravely you had fought,
      not only your enemies, but his enemies and the enemies of France. And,
      oh!&rdquo;&mdash;here again the black eyes take on that perilous softness&mdash;&ldquo;I
      can be eloquent when I talk of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones looks tender things, as though he also might be
      eloquent, let him but pick subject and audience. Altogether there is much
      to support the gossip-loving Madame Houdetot, in what she has said
      concerning that summer house at Brest. The voice of the good Doctor again
      takes precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until then, it had been an axiom of naval Europe that no one on even
      terms, guns and men and ship, could whip the British on the ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor and Mr. Adams are discussing the <i>Ranger</i> and the Drake, a
      topic that has been rocking France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; goes on the girl-Duchess, with a further dulcet flash of those
      eyes, fed of fire and romance, &ldquo;you are to have a ship. Here is the king&rsquo;s
      order to his Minister of Marine&mdash;the shuffler De Sartine. Now there
      shall be no more shuffling.&rdquo; She gives Captain Paul Jones the orders. &ldquo;The
      ship is the <i>Duras</i>, lying at l&rsquo;Orient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Duras!</i>&rdquo; exclaims Captain Paul Jones. &ldquo;An ex-Indiaman!&mdash;a
      good ship, too; she mounts forty guns.&rdquo; Then, as his gaze rests on Doctor
      Franklin, laying down diplomatic law and fact to Mr. Adams, who listens
      with a preposterously conceited cock to his head: &ldquo;What say you, my friend&mdash;my
      best, my dearest friend! Let us re-name the <i>Duras</i> for the good
      Doctor. Shall we not call it the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess looks her acquiescence as she would have looked it to any
      proposal from so near and sweet and dear a quarter. Thus the <i>Bon Homme
      Richard</i> is born, and the <i>Duras</i> disappears. The Doctor,
      unconscious of the honor done him, is saying to Madame Helvetius, whose
      fat arm is thrown across his philosophic shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, madam! It is arranged; I shall dine at your house
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess and Captain Paul Jones hear nothing of these prandial
      arrangements for the morrow. They are again conversing; and, for all they
      talk constantly, they say more with their eyes than with their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lastly,&rdquo; and here the words of the girl-Duchess grow distinct, &ldquo;your
      ship, they tell me, will need refitting. That will take money, my friend;
      and so I hand you this letter to my banker, Gourlade, instructing him to
      put ten thousand louis to your credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones puts the letter of credit aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;De Chaumont has&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>must</i> take it!&rdquo; interrupts the girl-Duchess, her eyes beginning
      to swim. &ldquo;You shall not put to sea, and risk your life, and the ship not
      half prepared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall more easily risk my life a thousand times, than permit you to
      give me money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Captain Paul Jones says this, a resentful red is burning on his brow.
      Doctor Franklin breaks in from over the way, with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not too much listen to Mr. Lee, sir. I tell you that the
      French merchants have offered to send Captain Jones to sea as admiral of
      an entire fleet of privateers, and he refused. Have my word, sir; the last
      thing he thinks on is money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess is gazing reproachfully at Captain Paul Jones. At last
      she speaks slowly and with a kind of sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not give you money&mdash;do not offer it. What! money and&mdash;you!
      Never!&rdquo; Then proudly: &ldquo;I give my money to the Cause.&rdquo; After this high note
      is struck, the flash dies down; the black eyes again go wavering to the
      floor, while the voice retreats to the old soft whisper. &ldquo;It is my heart
      &mdash;only my heart that I give to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strident, unmollified tones of Mr. Adams get possession of the field.
      He is condemning the French press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They declare, sir,&rdquo; he is saying, &ldquo;that I am not the celebrated Mr.
      Adams; that I am a cipher, a fanatic and a bigot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin laughs. &ldquo;What harm is there in the French papers, sir?&rdquo; he
      returns. &ldquo;Give them no heed, sir, give them no heed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Brillon makes preparations to depart; Madame Houdetot, Mrs. Adams
      and the rest adopt her example. And still the girl-Duchess holds Captain
      Paul Jones to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to have one evening&mdash;one before you go?&rdquo; she pleads; and her
      tones are a woman&rsquo;s tones and deeply wistful; and are not in any respect
      the tones of a Bourbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evening? You shall have every evening&mdash;ay! and every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; and as she makes ready to go the girl-Duchess takes firmer
      command of her manner and her voice; &ldquo;remember! You have promised to lay
      an English frigate at my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall do; or lay my bones away in the Atlantic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess shivers at this picture, and as though for reassurance
      steals her slim hand into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that!&rdquo; she pleads. His strong brown fingers close courageously on the
      slender ones. &ldquo;I cannot bear the thought! In victory or defeat, come
      back!&rdquo; Then, sighing rather than saying: &ldquo;Come back to me&mdash;my
      untitled knight of the sea!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE SAILING OF THE &ldquo;RICHARD&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>aptain Paul Jones
      goes down to l&rsquo;Orient to begin the overhaul and refit of the <i>Richard</i>.
      The ship is twenty years old, and he finds it shaken and worn by time and
      weather. It is not a good ship, not a ship on which a prudent commander
      would care to stake his life and reputation; but it is the best he can
      get, and Captain Paul Jones accepts it, shrugging his shoulders. He has
      been so beaten upon by disappointments, so carked and rusted by delays,
      since his old ship <i>Ranger</i> spread its sails for home, and left him
      as it were an exile on French shores, that rather than further endure such
      heart-eating experiences he is ready to embrace the desperate. As the work
      of refitting progresses, Doctor Franklin comes over from Passy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship is old, Doctor,&rdquo; says Captain Paul Jones, as he and Doctor
      Franklin canvass the situation. &ldquo;That, however, is the least of my
      troubles. What causes me most uneasiness is the crew. Out of a whole
      muster of three hundred and seventy-five, no more than fifty are
      Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not trust the French? Surely you don&rsquo;t mean to say they are
      not brave men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave enough&mdash;the French; but that is not the point. They are not
      good water fighters. By nature they are too hysterical, too easily
      excited, to both sail and fight a ship. Those English whom we go to meet
      are born water dogs, stubborn and cool; and the only ones afloat who, man
      for man, may match them are Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of Americans you have but fifty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only fifty.&rdquo; Then, with a heartfelt oath: &ldquo;I would give my left hand to
      have back my old crew of the <i>Ranger</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones begins pacing to and fro, his thoughts running
      regretfully on the <i>Ranger</i>, and those stout hearts with whom he
      fought the <i>Drake</i>. But the <i>Ranger</i> and those stout, tarry ones
      are half a world away; and in the end he returns perforce to the <i>Richard</i>,
      and what poor tools in the way of crew are offered him by Fate. There is,
      too, a matter of gravity which he desires to lay before the Doctor&rsquo;s older
      and more prudent judgment. For Captain Paul Jones, so unmanageable by
      others, defers to the sagacious Doctor, and accepts his opinions and
      follows his commands with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Captain Pierre Landais, Doctor,&rdquo; he begins, &ldquo;who is to sail the <i>Alliance</i>
      in my company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; interrupts the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him?&mdash;you have confidence in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor purses his lips, but says never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think!&rdquo; cries Captain Paul Jones, who reads
      distrust in the good Doctor&rsquo;s pursed but silent lips; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what
      I think, and what I&rsquo;ll do. Already I&rsquo;ve had some dealings with this
      Landais. The fellow is mad&mdash;vanity-mad. Jealous, insubordinate, he
      has twice taken open occasion to disobey my orders. This I have stomached
      in silence&mdash;being on French shores. I now warn you that as soon as I
      find myself in blue water, at a first sign of rebellion against my
      authority, I&rsquo;ll clap the fellow in irons. By heaven! I&rsquo;ll string him to
      his own yard arm, sir; make a tassel of him for the winds to play with, if
      it be required to preserve a discipline which his example has already done
      much to break down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin meets this violent setting forth concerning the
      recalcitrant Landais with a negative gesture of unmistakable emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do nothing of the kind, Paul!&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;Captain Landais, as
      you say, is doubtless mad&mdash;vanity-mad. But he is also French; and we
      must do nothing to estrange from our cause French sympathy and French
      assistance. I urge you to bear with Landais in silence, rather than
      jeopardize us with King Louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones growlingly submits. &ldquo;It will result disastrously,
      Doctor,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We shall yet suffer for it, mark my word.&rdquo; Then,
      disgustedly: &ldquo;I marvel that the Marine Committee in Philadelphia should
      turn over to such a madman a brisk frigate like the <i>Alliance</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, the Marquis de Lafayette, had something to do with it, I
      think. You observe that on his present visit to France, it is Landais with
      his <i>Alliance</i> who brings him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones says no more, but seems to accept Landais as he accepts
      the <i>Richard</i>, desperately. His final comment shows the uneasy
      complexion of his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do the best we can, Doctor,&rdquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young as I am, I have lived long enough to know that one can&rsquo;t have all
      things ordered as he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Paul Jones, now commodore, clears for the Irish coast on a bright,
      clear day in June. Besides the <i>Richard</i>, he has with him the <i>Alliance</i>,
      thirty-two guns, Captain Landais; the <i>Pallas</i>, twenty-eight guns,
      Captain Cottineau; and the <i>Vengeance</i>, twelve guns, Captain Ricon.
      Four days later he returns limping into l&rsquo;Orient for repairs, the <i>Richard</i>
      having been fouled by the <i>Alliance</i> through the criminal
      carelessness or worse of Captain Landais.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breast of the young commodore is on fire with anger over the delay,
      and the vicious clumsiness that caused it. He burns to destroy Landais, as
      the mean reason of his troubles, but the thought of Doctor Franklin
      restrains him. Also, as events unfold, that enforced return to l&rsquo;Orient
      proves of good fortune, and he forgets his chagrin in joy over the
      flattering new turn in his affairs. Doctor Franklin has succeeded in
      bringing about an exchange of prisoners, and barters to the British
      admiralty one hundred and nineteen Englishmen, captured in the <i>Drake</i>
      and other prizes taken by the <i>Ranger</i>, for one hundred and nineteen
      Americans held by King George. While Commodore Paul Jones is curing the
      damage done the <i>Richard</i> by the evil Landais, those exchanged
      Americans are landed under a cartel in Nantes. He goes down to Nantes and
      enlists one hundred and fifteen of them for the <i>Richard</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Commodore Paul Jones weighs anchor for a second start, he goes over
      to Passy for a final word with Doctor Franklin. The pair walk in the
      Doctor&rsquo;s favorite garden, now a wilderness of foliage and flowers, the
      Doctor serene, the boy commodore cloudy, taciturn and grim. His resolution
      has set iron-hard to do or die; the cruise shall be a glorious one or be
      his last. Doctor Franklin asks about his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make for the west coast of Ireland,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and go north about
      the British islands. Wind and weather favoring, I may sack a town or two
      by way of retaliation for what the foe has done to us. They will find that
      I have not forgotten Lord Dunmore, and my ruined plantation by the
      Rappahannock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waters you will sail in are alive with British ships of war. With
      your poor force it seems a desperate cruise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desperate, yes; but, Doctor, we are in no shape to play cautious. We are
      weak; therefore we must be reckless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a strange doctrine,&rdquo; muses the Doctor. &ldquo;And yet I will not say but
      what it smells of judgment. I have faith in you, Paul; it teaches me to
      hope that, when next I greet you, I shall greet a victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones, and his tones are grave with
      meaning, &ldquo;I shall not disappoint you. Nor do I care to conceal from you my
      resolution. When I sail, I sail looking for battle; and I shall not
      hesitate to engage an enemy superior to my force. The condition of our
      cause is such that, to sustain it, we need a striking, ay! a startling
      naval success, and I shall do all I know, fight all I know, to bring it to
      pass. More; my mind is made up: If I fail, I fall; I shall return
      victorious or I shall not return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is daybreak on a day in middle August when Commodore Paul Jones, with
      the <i>Richard</i> as flagship of the little squadron of four, puts the
      Isle of Groaix astern, and points for the open ocean. His course is west
      by north, so as to weather Cape Clear, and fetch the Irish coast close
      aboard. With winds light and baffling, the squadron&rsquo;s pace is slow; it is
      nine days out of France before Cape Clear is sighted. Then it creeps
      northward along the Irish coast, Commodore Paul Jones vigilant and alert.
      He takes a prize or two, and one after the other sends into French ports
      the British ships <i>Mayflower</i> and <i>Fortune</i>. The young
      commodore&rsquo;s brow begins to clear; those prizes comfort him vastly. At
      least the cruise shall not be registered as altogether fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the last day of August; the Hebrides lie off the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s
      starboard beam. A stiff gale from the northwest sets in, and the squadron
      is driven east by north under storm staysails. This dovetails with the
      desires of Commodore Paul Jones; wherefore he welcomes the gale as
      friendly weather. Also, it gives him a chance to try out the <i>Richard</i>,
      which shows lively with the wind abaft the beam, but dull to the confines
      of despair when sailing on a wind. Close-hauled, the <i>Richard</i> makes
      more lee than headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means, Dick,&rdquo; says Commodore Paul Jones judgmatically, to
      Lieutenant Richard Dale&mdash;&ldquo;which means, Dick, that we must have the
      weather-gage before we lock horns with an enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Off Cape Wraith, Commodore Paul Jones is so fortunate as to take two
      further prizes. He turns them over to Captain Landais, with orders to send
      them into Brest. The Frenchman, who only receives an order for the purpose
      of breaking it, sends them into the port of Bergen, where the Norwegians
      promptly turn them over to the English, on an argument that they do not
      officially know of any government called the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones works slowly and cautiously southward along the east
      coast of Scotland. Off the Firth of Forth he decides to attack the Port of
      Leith, and stands in for that fell purpose. An adverse gale, seconded by
      off-shore currents, comes to the rescue of the threatened Scotchmen; in
      the teeth of his best seamanship Commodore Paul Jones and his squadron are
      driven out to sea. Thus the chance passes, and the sack of Leith is
      abandoned. It is a sore setback to the hopes of Commodore Paul Jones; but
      it lifts a load from the Scottish heart, to whom the Stars and Stripes
      have brought visions of pillage and torch and desolation. The news flies
      over England; beacons burn on each headland; while every semaphore is
      telling that the dreaded Paul Jones is hawking at the English coasts. The
      word causes a tremendous loss of British sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off Spurn Head our industrious young commodore sinks one collier and
      chases another ashore. Being full of curiosity, he takes a peep into the
      mouth of the Humber, and discovers a frightened fleet of British merchant
      vessels. The merchantmen are in a flutter at the sight of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s
      dread topsails; the frigate that it conveying them has its work cut out,
      to nurse them into anything like calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the look into the Humber, that sets so many timid merchantmen to
      shivering, Commodore Paul Jones puts out to sea under doublereefs. He
      plans to stand off and on throughout the night, and swoop on those
      tremblers, like a hawk on a covey of quail, with the first gray streaks of
      dawn. The frigate will doubtless fight, but the optimistic young commodore
      reckons on making short work of that man-of-war. In the middle watch the
      little brig <i>Vengeance</i> runs under the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s lee, bringing
      word of a nobler quarry. The Baltic timber fleet, fifty sail in all,
      convoyed by the <i>Serapis</i> and the <i>Countess of Scarboro</i> has
      just put into Bridlington Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this good news, Commodore Paul Jones gives up his designs touching the
      frightened covey of merchantmen in the Humber. He prefers the Baltic
      timber ships with the <i>Serapis</i>, the difference between the one and
      the other being the difference between deer and hare. He orders the <i>Vengeance</i>
      to stand out to sea, find the <i>Alliance</i>, and tell Captain Landais to
      join him off Scarboro&rsquo; Head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not,&rdquo; says he to Captain Ricon, &ldquo;give Captain Landais this notice
      in the guise of an order. He would make a point of disobeying, and seize
      on its reception as a pat occasion for insulting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the <i>Vengeance</i> stands eastward in search of the <i>Alliance</i>,
      Commodore Paul Jones signals the __Pallas__ to follow, and turns his bows
      for Scarboro&rsquo; Head, then forty miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Richard</i>, the little <i>Pallas</i> close to its heels, cracks on
      canvas throughout the night. The winds are mere puffs and catspaws; still,
      slow as is their speed, daylight finds them within throwing distance of
      their destination. They are the wrong-side of the weather, however, and
      the whole day is wasted in beating inshore against the wind. Our young
      commodore must do all the work; for the English merchantmen, as though
      faint with fear at the sight of him, refuse to come out; while the <i>Serapis</i>
      and its consort stick close to them in their role of guardships. The sun
      goes down, night descends, and as yet our young commodore has not been
      able to get within reach of the foe; for at beating to windward the <i>Richard</i>
      is as dull as a Dutchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When darkness comes, it unlooses a land breeze. With that the merchantmen
      take heart of grace, and resolve to dare all and run for it. They rush out
      of Bridlington Bay, wind free, like a flock of seagulls. What is a fair
      wind for them is a headwind for the <i>Richard</i> and <i>Pallas</i>; with
      no one to molest them, the fifty timber ships show a clean pair of heels.
      Commodore Paul Jones makes no effort to chase; it would be seamanship
      thrown away. Besides, the <i>Serapis</i> has laid its sails aback, and is
      waiting to hear from him; while the <i>Countess of Scarboro</i> guarding
      the flanks of the fugitive timber ships, seems eagerly willing to try
      conclusions with the <i>Pallas</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temptation is too great; Commodore Paul Jones makes no least effort to
      resist it. Signaling the <i>Pallas</i> to close with and pull down the
      smaller ship, with his own eye on the <i>Serapis</i>, he begins
      manoeuvring for the upper hand. The sea is as smooth as glass; a great
      harvest moon shoots up in the cloudless sky. As when the <i>Ranger</i>
      fought the <i>Drake</i>, it is to be a fight by the light of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Richard</i> tacks starboard and port, the <i>Serapis</i> lying in
      wait. Decks cleared, guns shotted and run out, magazines open, men
      stripped and at their quarters, both ships are as ferociously ready as
      bulldogs. Commodore Paul Jones scans the <i>Serapis</i> through his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How heavy is he, Commodore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is Dr. Brooke, surgeon of the <i>Richard</i>, who puts the question. He
      has been laying out his instruments and bandages in the cockpit, in
      readiness for a hard night&rsquo;s work, and now pokes his nose on deck for a
      last breath of fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Doctor?&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones. The amiable tones
      bespeak that bland urbanity which is his dominant characteristic on the
      threshold of battle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Serapis</i>; a forty-four-gun ship of
      the Rainbow class, six months off the stocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It should be observed that Commodore Paul Jones&rsquo; pet study is the British
      navy, and he knows more about it&mdash;ships, guns, and men&mdash;than
      does the king&rsquo;s admiralty itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-four guns! Rainbow class!&rdquo; repeats the worthy doctor, who himself
      is not without a working knowledge of ships and their comparative
      strengths. &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s a stronger ship, with heavier metal, than the <i>Richard</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As three is to two, Doctor,&rdquo; replies Commodore Paul Jones, shutting up
      his glass and preparing for action. &ldquo;None the less, we shall fight them
      and beat them just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aboard the <i>Serapis</i>, Captain Pearson is holding his glass on the <i>Richard</i>,
      not a cable&rsquo;s length away. Suddenly the <i>Richard</i> wears and backs its
      topsail, thereby bringing its broadside to bear upon the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a clever manoeuvre!&rdquo; remarks Captain Pearson, admiringly, to
      Lieutenant Wright, who stands by his side. &ldquo;It holds for him the
      weather-gage, and makes it impossible for me to luff across his hawse,
      without exposing my ship to be raked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asks Lieutenant Wright; for the <i>Serapis</i> is just home
      from Norway, and the word that set all England to lighting beacons and
      doubling coast-guards has not reached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; repeats Captain Pearson, soberly. &ldquo;He is Paul Jones; and, my
      word for it, Lieutenant, there is work ahead.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE &ldquo;RICHARD&rdquo; AND THE &ldquo;SERAPIS&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he ships are
      slowly closing, watchful as wrestlers striving for holds, the <i>Richard</i>
      edging down with the wind, the <i>Serapis</i> holding on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; hails Captain Pearson.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; comes the second hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The response is a storm of solid shot from the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s flaming
      broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the <i>Richard</i> goes into action, Commodore Paul Jones swings his
      glass along the eastern horizon. The <i>Pallas</i> is going down the wind,
      in hot pursuit of the <i>Countess of Scarboro</i>, yawing and firing its
      bow-chaser as it runs; while far out to sea lies the traitor Landais,
      sulking or skulking, it matters little which, his coward topsails just
      visible against the moonlit sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the wind aft, the <i>Richard</i> and the <i>Serapis</i> head
      northwest, both on the port tack. The moon makes the scene as light as
      day; the sea is as evenly smooth as a ballroom floor. The <i>Richard</i>
      goes over on the starboard tack, the <i>Serapis</i> holding as she is; the
      ships approach each other, the <i>Richard</i> keeping the weather-gage.
      For twenty minutes it is broadside and broadside as fast as men may handle
      sponge and rammer. As in the hour of the <i>Drake</i> and <i>Ranger</i>,
      the Yankees show smarter with their guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the battle begins, the <i>Richard</i> has to its broadside three
      eighteen-pounders, as against the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo; ten. With the first
      fire, two of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s three explode, killing half the men that
      serve them, and tearing open the main gun-deck immediately above.
      Lieutenant Mayrant, who has command in the gunroom where the three
      eighteens are mounted, reports the disaster to Commodore Paul Jones. The
      latter receives the news beamingly, as though it were the enemies&rsquo;
      eighteen-pounders, and not his own, that have been put out of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have only the twelve-pounders and the long nines to fight him
      with,&rdquo; says Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;It is now a thirty-two-gun ship against
      a forty-four. We shall beat him; and the honor will be the greater.&rdquo; Then,
      observing Lieutenant Mayrant to be severely wounded in the head, he
      becomes concerned for that young gentleman. &ldquo;Better go below to Brooks,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;and have your wounds dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get square for Portsea jail first,&rdquo; replies Lieutenant Mayrant,
      who is of those exchanged ones enlisted at Nantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale, forward with the twelve-pounders, comes aft to ask about
      the exploded eight guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were rotten when the Frenchmen sold them to us,&rdquo; says Lieutenant
      Dale bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; responds Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give half the prize money I
      shall get from yonder ship to have those Frenchmen here.&rdquo; Meanwhile the <i>Serapis</i>&mdash;not
      yet a prize&mdash;is fiercely belching flame and smoke, while her shot
      tear the vitals out of the <i>Richard</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ships have been fighting half an hour&mdash;rough broadside work; the
      <i>Richard</i> with its lighter metal has had the worst of the barter.
      They have sailed, or rather drifted, a mile and a half, edging closer to
      one another as they forge slowly to the north and west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Serapis</i>, being the livelier ship, has fore-reached on the <i>Richard</i>,
      and Captain Pearson sees the chance to luff across the latter&rsquo;s bows.
      Having torn the <i>Richard</i> open with a raking broadside, Captain
      Pearson will then go clear around the Yankee, put the <i>Serapis</i> upon
      the starboard tack, and claim in his turn the weather-gage. It is a
      brilliant thought, and Captain Pearson pulls down his helm to execute it.
      Already he sees victory in his fingers. He is radiant; it will make him a
      Knight Commander of the Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Captain Pearson is manoeuvring for that title, the hot broadside
      dispute proceeds with unflagging fury. Only the <i>Richard</i> is
      beginning to bleed and gasp; those ten eighteen-pounders of the <i>Serapis</i>
      overmaster its weaker batteries. Also, by this time they are doubly weak;
      for more than half of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s twelve-pounders have been
      dismounted, and the balance are so jammed with wreckage and splinters as
      to forbid them being worked. Lieutenant Dale reports the crippled
      condition of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s broadside to Commodore Paul Jones, where
      the latter stands on the after-deck, in personal command of the French
      marines, whose captain has crept below with a hurt knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have but three effective twelve-pounders left,&rdquo; says Lieutenant Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three?&rdquo; retorts Commodore Paul Jones, cheerfully. &ldquo;Now, well-aimed and
      low, Dick, much good damage may be worked with three twelve-pounders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale wipes the blood and sweat and powder-stains from his face,
      salutes, and goes back to his three guns; while Commodore Paul Jones,
      alive to the enemy&rsquo;s new manouvre, takes the wheel from the quartermaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      To check the ambitious Pearson in his efforts to luff across his forefoot,
      Commodore Paul Jones pays off the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s head a point. The check
      is not alone successful, but under the influence of that master hand, the
      <i>Richard</i> all but gets the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo; head into chancery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being defeated in his luff, Captain Pearson next discovers that his brisk
      antagonist has put him in a dilemma. If he holds on, the <i>Richard</i>
      will run him down; he can already see the great, black cutwater rearing
      itself on high, as though to crush him and cut him in two. If he pays off
      the head of the <i>Serapis</i>, and avoids being run down, the <i>Richard</i>
      will still foul and grapple with him. Lieutenant Mayrant&rsquo;s bandaged head
      shows above the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s hammock nettings, as, with grappling
      irons ready for throwing, he musters a party of boarders&mdash;cutlass and
      pistol and pike&mdash;to have them in hand the moment the ships crash
      together. That title of Knight Commander of the Bath, and the star and
      garter that go with it, do not look so near at hand. Also, the <i>Serapis</i>,
      at this closer range, begins to feel the musket-fire from the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s
      tops. One after another, three seamen are shot down at the wheel of the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this desperate emergency, Captain Pearson, good sailorman that he is,
      neither holds on nor pays off, but with everything thrown aback attempts
      to box-haul his ship. It may take the sticks out by the roots, but he must
      risk it. The chance is preferable to being either run down or boarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Serapis</i> is a new ship, fresh from the yards, and her spars and
      cordage stand the strain. Captain Pearson backs himself slowly out of the
      trap. He grazes fate so closely that the <i>Richard</i>, answering some
      sudden occult movement of the helm, runs its bowsprit over the larboard
      quarter of the <i>Serapis</i>, into its mizzen rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by with those grappling irons!&rdquo; shouts Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Mayrant throws the grapples with a seaman&rsquo;s accuracy; they
      catch, as he means they shall, in the mizzen backstays of the Englishman.
      But the ships have too much way on. The <i>Richard</i> forges ahead; the
      <i>Serapis</i>, every sail flattened, backs free; the lines part. Before
      Lieutenant Mayrant can take his jolly boarders over the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s
      bows, the ships have swung apart, and fifty feet of open water yawn
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Serapis</i> falls to leeward; at the end of the next five minutes
      both ships are back in their old positions, with their broadside guns&mdash;or
      what are left of them&mdash;at that furious work of hammer and tongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this crashing business of broadsiding, the <i>Richard</i> has no
      chance, and Commodore Paul Jones&mdash;a smile on his dauntless lips, eyes
      bright and glancing like those of a child with a new toy&mdash;stands well
      aware of it. He must board the Englishman, or he is lost. As showing what
      Captain Pearson&rsquo;s eighteen-pounders can do, the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s starboard
      battery&mdash;being the one in action&mdash;shows nine of its
      twelve-pounders dismounted from their carriages; while, of the one hundred
      and forty-three officers and men who belong with the main gun-deck battery
      under Lieutenant Dale, eighty-seven lie dead and wounded. The gun-deck
      itself, a-litter with dismounted guns and shot-smashed carriages and
      tackle, is slippery with blood, and choked by a red clutter of dead and
      wounded sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones turns to his orderly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Downes. &ldquo;Present my compliments to Lieutenant Dale,&rdquo; says lie, &ldquo;and
      ask him to step aft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bloody, powder-grimed, Lieutenant Dale responds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; observes Commodore Paul Jones, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s too heavy for us. We must
      close with him; we must get hold of him. Bring what men you have to the
      spar-deck, and serve out the small arms for boarding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breeze veers to the west, and freshens up a bit. This helps the <i>Richard</i>
      sooner than it does the <i>Serapis</i>; Commodore Paul Jones, having
      advantage of it, wears and makes directly for his enemy. This move, like a
      stroke of genius, brings him within one hundred feet of the <i>Serapis</i>,
      directly between it and the wind. It is his purpose to blanket the enemy,
      and steal the breeze from him. He succeeds; the <i>Serapis</i> loses way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now the turn of Commodore Paul Jones to go across his enemy&rsquo;s
      forefoot, and retort upon the <i>Serapis</i> that manouvre which Captain
      Pearson attempted against the <i>Richard</i>. But with this difference:
      Captain Pearson&rsquo;s purpose was to rake; Commodore Paul Jones&rsquo; purpose is to
      board; for he lias now no guns wherewith to rake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Serapis</i> is held as though in irons, canvas a-flap, by the
      blanket of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s broad sails. Slowly yet surely, like the
      coming of a doom, the <i>Richard</i> forges across the other&rsquo;s head. The
      design of Commodore Paul Jones is to lay the <i>Serapis</i> aboard, lash
      ship to ship, and sweep the Englishman&rsquo;s decks with his boarders. These,
      armed to the teeth, as ready for the rush as so many hunting dogs,
      Lieutenant Mayrant is holding in the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Richard</i> is half its length across the bows of the <i>Serapis</i>&mdash;still
      helpless, sails a-droop! Suddenly, by a twist of the helm, Commodore Paul
      Jones broaches the <i>Richard</i> to on the opposite tack, and doubles
      down on his prey. It is the beginning of the end. The jib-boom of the <i>Serapis</i>
      runs in over the poop-deck of the <i>Richard</i>; a turn is instantly
      taken on it with a small hawser by Lieutenant Dale, who makes all fast to
      the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s mizzen-mast. The ships swing closer and closer
      together; at last the two rasp broadside against broadside, the <i>Richard</i>
      still holding its way. As they grind along, the outboard fluke of the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo;
      starboard anchor catches in the Richard&rsquo;s mizzen-chains. First one, then
      another gives way; the third holds, and the ships lie together bow and
      stern. Commodore Paul Jones is over the side like a cat; the next moment
      he lashes the <i>Serapis</i> to the <i>Richard</i>, and the death-hug is
      at hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;HOW THE BATTLE RAGED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ommodore Paul
      Jones drops overboard his cocked hat. Orderly Jack Downes rushes into the
      cabin and gets another. Returning, he offers it to Commodore Paul Jones,
      who waves it away with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuck it through the skylight, Jack,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight this out in my
      scalp.&rdquo; Then, glancing forward at the sailors, naked to the waist: &ldquo;If it
      were not for the looks of the thing, I&rsquo;d off coat and shirt, and fight in
      the buff like yonder gallant hearties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a sudden smashing of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s bulwarks, a splintering
      of spars; a sleet of shot, grape and solid and bar, tears through the
      ship! In the wake of that hail of iron comes the thunder of the guns&mdash;loud
      and close aboard! Commodore Paul Jones looks about in angry wonder; that
      broadside was not from the <i>Serapis</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Alliance!</i>&rdquo; cries Lieutenant Dale, rushing aft. &ldquo;Landais
      is firing on us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not half a cable-length away lies the Alliance, head to the wind, topsails
      back, half hidden in a curling smother of powder-smoke. There comes but
      the one broadside. Even as Commodore Paul Jones looks, the traitor&rsquo;s head
      pays slowly off; a moment later the sails belly and fill, and the Alliance
      is running seaward before the wind. Commodore Paul Jones grits out a
      curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Landais! Was ever another such a villain out of hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The villain Landais makes off. There is no time for maledictions; besides,
      a court-martial will come later for that miscreant. Just now Captain
      Pearson, with his <i>Serapis</i>, claims the attention of Commodore Paul
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tackle takes the strain; the lashings, and that fortunate starboard
      anchor of the <i>Serapis</i>, hold the ships together. Captain Pearson
      sees the peril, and the way to free himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut away that sta&rsquo;board anchor!&rdquo; he cries. Then, as a seaman armed with a
      hatchet springs forward, he continues: &ldquo;The ring-stopper, man! Cut the
      shank-painter and the ring-stopper; let the anchor go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones snatches a firelock from one of the agitated French
      marines. Steadying himself against a backstay, he raises the weapon to his
      shoulder and fires. The ball goes crashing through the seaman&rsquo;s head as he
      raises his hatchet to cut free the anchor. Another leaps forward and
      grasps the hatchet. Seizing a second firelock, Commodore Paul Jones
      stretches him across the anchor&rsquo;s shank, where he lies clutching and
      groaning and bleeding his life away. As the second man goes down, those
      nearest fall back. That fatal starboard anchor is a death-trap; they want
      none of it! Commodore Paul Jones, alert as a wildcat and as bent for
      blood, keeps grim watch, firelock in fist, at the backstay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned those hitches with my own hands,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll shoot down
      any Englishman who meddles with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French marines, despite the hardy example of Commodore Paul Jones, are
      in a panic. Their Captain Cammillard is wounded, and has retired below.
      Now their two lieutenants are gone. Besides, of the more than one hundred
      to go into the fight, no more than twenty-five remain. These,
      nerve-shattered and deeming all as lost, are fallen into disorder and
      dismay. The centuries have taught them to fear these sullen English. The
      lesson has come down to them in the blood of their fathers who fought at
      Crécy, Poitiers, Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet that these bulldog
      islanders are unconquerable! Panic grasps them at the moment of all
      moments when Commodore Paul Jones requires them most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing them thus shaken and beaten in their hearts, Commodore Paul Jones&mdash;who
      knows Frenchmen in their impulses as he knows his own face in a glass&mdash;adopts
      the theatrical. He rushes into their midst, thundering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my friends! What a day for France is this! We have these dogs of
      English at our mercy! Courage but a little while, my friends, and the day
      is ours! Oh, what a day for France!&rdquo; As adding éclat to that day for
      France, Commodore Paul Jones snatches a third firelock from the nearest
      marine, and shoots down a third Briton who, hatchet upraised, is rushing
      upon that detaining anchor. Following this exploit, he wheels again upon
      those wavering marines, and by way of raising their spirits pours forth in
      French such a cataract of curses upon all Englishmen and English things
      that it fairly exhausts the imagination of his hearers to keep abreast of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre Gerard, the little Breton sailor who, with Jack Downes, acts as
      orderly to Commodore Paul Jones, is swept off his feet in admiration of
      his young commander&rsquo;s fire and profane fluency. Little Pierre takes fire
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; he cries, addressing Jack Downes, who being from New Hampshire
      understands never a word of Pierre&rsquo;s French, albeit he takes it in,
      open-mouthed, like spring water; &ldquo;See! He springs among them like a tiger
      among calves! Ah, they respond to him! Yes, in an instant he arouses their
      courage! They look upon him&mdash;him, who has bravery without end! Name
      of God! To see him is to become a hero!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is as the excitable little Pierre recounts. The French marines, lately
      so cowed, look upon Commodore Paul Jones to become heroes. With shouts and
      cries they crowd about him valorously. He directs their fire against the
      English, who man the long-nines in the open waist of the <i>Serapis</i>.
      The fire of the recovered Frenchmen drives those English from their guns.
      Thereupon the French go wild with a fierce joy, and are all for boarding
      the <i>Serapis</i>. Commodore Paul Jones has as much trouble restraining
      them from rushing forward as he had but a moment before to keep them from
      falling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Pearson has never taken his eyes from that fatal starboard anchor,
      holding him fast to the <i>Richard</i>. There it lies, his own anchor&mdash;the
      key-stone to the arch of his ruin! If it take every English life aboard
      the <i>Serapis</i>, it must be cut away! He orders four men forward in a
      body, to cut shank-painter and ring-stopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There comes an instant volley from the recovered French marines, led by
      Commodore Paul Jones, who fires with them. Before that withering volley
      the four hatchet-men fall in a crumpled, bloody heap. The fatal anchor
      still holds; the ships grind side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Pearson orders forward more men, and still more men, to cut away
      that anchor, which is as an anchor of death, tying him broadside and
      broadside to destruction. Fourteen men die, one across the other, under
      the fire of Commodore Paul Jones and his French marines&mdash;each of the
      latter being now a volcano of fiery valor! The last to perish is
      Lieutenant Popplewill; he dies honorably at the hands of Commodore Paul
      Jones himself, who sends a musket ball through the high heart of the young
      dreadnought just as he reaches those fatal fastenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this labor of death and bloody slaughter goes on above, the smashing
      work of the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo; eighteen-pounders has not ceased between
      decks. As the two ships come together, the lower-tier gun crews of the <i>Serapis</i>
      are shifted from the port to the starboard batteries. They attempt to run
      out the guns, and are withstood by the port-lids, which refuse to be
      triced up, the <i>Richard</i> grinding them so hard and close as to hold
      them fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cries Lieutenant Wright, who has command of the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo;
      eighteen-pounders; &ldquo;the ports won&rsquo;t open? Open them with your round-shot,
      then, my hearties! Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the broadside of the <i>Serapis</i> is fired through its own planks
      and timbers, to open a way to the <i>Richard</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cries Lieutenant Wright exultantly, &ldquo;that should give your guns a
      chance to breathe, my bucks! Now show us how fast you can send your iron
      aboard the Yankee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The English broadside men respond with such goodwill that they literally
      cut the <i>Richard</i> in two between decks with their tempest of solid
      eighteen-pound shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this smashing battery work goes forward, hammer and anvil, the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo;
      twelve-pounders are tearing and rending the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s upper decks,
      piling them in ruins. Every twelve-pounder belonging to the <i>Richard</i>
      is rendered dumb. Only three long-nines remain in service. These are
      mounted on the quarter-deck, under the eye of Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, Mr. Lindthwait, you train them on the enemy&rsquo;s mainmast!&rdquo; he
      observes to the midshipman, under whose command he places the three
      long-nines. &ldquo;Try for his mainmast, young man! It will be good gunnery
      practise for you; and should you cut the stick in two, so much the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Midshipman Lindthwait serves his trio of long nines with so much relish
      and vivacious accuracy that he soon has the mainmast of the <i>Serapis</i>
      cut half away. Leaving him to his task, Commodore Paul Jones again takes
      his French marines in hand, uplifts their souls with a fresh torrent of
      anti-English vituperation, and keeps them to the business of clearing the
      enemy&rsquo;s deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the nine-pound shot of the industrious Lindthwait, flying low,
      strikes the main hatch of the <i>Serapis</i>, and slews the hatch cover to
      one side. It leaves a triangular opening, eighteen inches on its longish
      side, at one corner of the hatch. Commodore Paul Jones has his hawklike
      eye on it instantly. He points it out to midshipman Fanning and gunner
      Henry Gardner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your chance, my lads!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Sharp&rsquo;s the word now! Lay aloft
      on the main topsail yard, with a bucketful of hand-grenades, and see if
      you can&rsquo;t chuck one into her belly. A few hand-grenades, exploding among
      their eighteen-pounders below decks, would go far towards showing these
      English the error of their ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Off skurry Midshipman Fanning and Gunner Gardner, with three sailors close
      behind. A moment later they are racing up the shrouds like monkeys, two
      ratlins at a time. Buckets of hand-grenades go with them, while Lieutenant
      Stack rigs a whip to the maintop to send them up a fresh supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five lie out on the main topsail yard, like a quintette of squirrels,
      midshipman Fanning, a bright lad from New London, getting the place of
      honor at the earring. The three sailors pass the hand-grenades, gunner
      Gardner fires the fuse with his slow match, while midshipman Fanning,
      perched at the farthest end of the yard, hurls them at that eighteen-inch
      triangle, where the hatch cover of the <i>Serapis</i> has been shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty feet below the hand-grenade quintette, Commodore Paul Jones is again
      dealing out profane encouragement to his marines, for their ardor sensibly
      slackens the moment he takes his eye off them. They do good work, however&mdash;these
      Frenchmen! Under their fire the upper deck of the <i>Serapis</i> becomes a
      slaughter-pen. One after another, seven men are shot down at the
      Englishman&rsquo;s wheel. This does not affect the <i>Serapis</i>; since, locked
      together in the death grapple, both ships are adrift, and have paid no
      attention to their helms for twenty minutes. Still, it does the Frenchmen
      good to shoot down those wheelmen. Also, it mortifies the pride of the
      English; for to be unable to stay at one&rsquo;s own wheel is in its way a
      disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Commodore Paul Jones is uplifting his Frenchmen, and improving their
      small-arm practice, orderly Jack Downes, who has been forward to
      Lieutenant Dale with an order, comes rushing aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Dale, sir, reports six feet of water in our hold; and coming
      in fast, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orderly Jack Downes touches his forelock, face as stolid aw a statue&rsquo;s,
      and not at all as though he has just reported the ship to be sinking.
      Commodore Paul Jones smiles approval on stolid Jack Downes; he likes
      coolness and self-command. Before he can speak, Lieutenant Mayrant comes
      aft to say that the <i>Richard</i> is on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catches from the enemy&rsquo;s wadding,&rdquo; says Lieutenant Mayrant. &ldquo;For you must
      understand, sir, that when the enemy&rsquo;s eighteen-pounders are run out,
      their muzzles pierce through the shot-holes in our sides&mdash;we lay that
      close! As it is, they&rsquo;ve set us all ablaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got the flames in hand?&rdquo; Commodore Paul Jones puts the
      question confidently. He is sure that Lieutenant Mayrant wouldn&rsquo;t be by
      his side at that moment unless the fire is under command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Stack, with ten men to pass the buckets, sir, are attending to
      it. It&rsquo;s quite easy, the water in our hold being so deep. They have but to
      dip it up and throw it on the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I call making one
      hand wash the other. We put out the flames that are eating us up with the
      water that is sinking us.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE SURRENDER OF THE &ldquo;SERAPIS&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>aster-at-arms John
      Burbank looks over the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s side, and makes a discovery. The
      ship has settled three feet below its trim. Thereupon he loses his head,
      which was never a strong head, but somewhat thick, and addled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship is sinking!&rdquo; he shouts; then, being a humanitarian, he tears off
      the orlop-hatch, and calls to the two hundred prisoners shut up below to
      save themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the invitation of Humanitarian Burbank, the prisoners rush up. Fifty of
      them have gained the deck when Commodore Paul Jones perceives them.
      Pulling a pistol from his belt, he charges forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who released these prisoners?&rdquo; he demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship is sinking, sir,&rdquo; replies Humanitarian Burbank. &ldquo;I released them
      to give them a chance for their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eye ablaze, Commodore Paul Jones snaps his pistol in the face of
      Humanitarian Burbank. Fortunately for that philanthropist, the priming has
      been shaken out; while the flint throws off a shower of sparks, the pistol
      does not explode. Upon its failure to fire. Commodore Paul Jones clubs the
      heavy weapon, and fells Humanitarian Burbank to the deck. The latter comes
      to presently, to find himself disrated on the ship&rsquo;s books, and his addled
      pate more addled than before. As Humanitarian Burbank falls to the deck,
      Commodore Paul Jones makes a dash for the prisoners, who, two abreast, are
      pushing up from the deck below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under hatches with them!&rdquo; he cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rouses Midshipman Potter, who brings up a half dozen cutlass men, and
      those of the prisoners not yet on deck are held below. The orlop-hatch is
      again fitted to its place, and Commodore Paul Jones breathes freer. Two
      hundred prisoners loose about his decks is not what he most desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set them to the pumps, Dick,&rdquo; he says, addressing Lieutenant Dale. &ldquo;Give
      them plenty of work.&rdquo; Then, to the fifty prisoners who gained the deck:
      &ldquo;Now, my men, to the pumps, all of you! I&rsquo;ll have no idlers about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners go to the pumps readily enough&mdash;all save a stubborn
      merchant captain, whose ship was captured by the <i>Richard</i> off the
      port of Leith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye go a-nigh the pumps, mates!&rdquo; sings out the stubborn one. &ldquo;Let
      the damned Yankee pirate sink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey the Commodore, sare!&rdquo; pipes up little Pierre Gerard, presenting a
      pistol at the head of the mutineer. &ldquo;Obey the Commodore, or I shoot,
      sare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stubborn Scotch captain does not understand little Pierre&rsquo;s broken
      English, but the pistol is easily construed. For reply, he makes a quick
      grab at the weapon. Little Pierre, not to be caught napping, shoots him
      promptly through the head. As the stubborn one drops lifeless, the little
      Breton wheels on Commodore Paul Jones, lays his hand on his heart, and
      makes an apologetic bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shoot heem, sare, to relieve you of a disagreeable duty,&rdquo; says little
      Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other prisoners are not unimpressed by the fate of the stubborn one,
      and set to work briskly, if not cheerfully, at the clanking pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Commodore Paul Jones reaches the quarterdeck, following the incident
      wherein Humanitarian Burbank performs, and the stubborn Scotch captain
      dies, the ensign-gaff of the <i>Richard</i> is shot away, and the virgin
      petticoat flag of the pretty New Hampshire girls trails overboard. This
      gives rise to a misunderstanding. Gunner Arthur Randall, missing the
      ensign, and his hopes being somewhat low at the time, calls out to the
      Englishman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease firing! We&rsquo;ve surrendered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Pearson, on the quarter-deck of the <i>Serapis</i>, hears the cry.
      There could have come no more welcome news! Captain Pearson would have
      heard gunner Randall if the latter had spoken in a whisper! Face aglow
      with joy, Captain Pearson hails the <i>Richard</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you surrender?&rdquo; he demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones leaps to the rail of the <i>Richard</i>, and sustains
      himself by one of the afterbraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender?&rdquo; he repeats, his brow dark with rage. &ldquo;Surrender? I would have
      you to know, sir, that we&rsquo;ve just begun to fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back to the deck springs Commodore Paul Jones, while the face of Captain
      Pearson is stricken old and white. For the earliest time he realizes the
      desperate heart of that unconquerable one who has him in a death-grapple,
      and a premonition of his own defeat pierces his heart like a dagger of
      ice. As Commodore Paul Jones regains the deck, he observes Boatswain Jack
      Robinson who has waddled aft. The cloud of anger fades from his brow, and
      he breaks into a loud laugh that is tenfold worse than the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Jack, old trump! What say you to quitting?&rdquo; he cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! as to surrenderin&rsquo;, Commodore,&rdquo; says Boatswain Jack Robinson,
      refreshing himself with a huge chew of tobacco, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for sinkin&rsquo; alongside
      an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; &lsquo;em damned first! Sink alongside, says I; an&rsquo; if the grapplin&rsquo;
      tackle holds, we&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;em with us to Davy Jones, d&rsquo;ye see! An&rsquo; that&rsquo;ll
      be a comfort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the heart of oak!&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones, in vast approval
      of Boatswain Jack Robinson&rsquo;s turgid views; &ldquo;and when we&rsquo;re next ashore in
      New London, old shipmate, I&rsquo;ll tell Polly all about it. Meanwhile, our
      ensign&rsquo;s trailing astern. Set it aboard by the halyards, fish and splice
      the gaff, and put it back in its place. Give the Englishmen a sight of
      that red, white and blue flag, Jack; it takes the fight out of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; responds Boatswain Jack Robinson, as he begins the task of
      recovering and replacing the ensign. &ldquo;That flag does seem to let the whey
      out of a Britisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is gratuitous slander on the parts of both Commodore Paul Jones and
      Boatswain Jack Robinson; for those villified ones have been fighting for
      hours, and are still at it with the quenchless valor of so many mastiffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is that at hand, however, that will daunt their iron courage and
      feed even their stout hearts to dismay. High up at the weather earring of
      the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s main topsail yard, Midshipman Fanning has been
      faithfully practicing with hand-grenades at that inviting triangular hole,
      where the hatch-cover of the <i>Serapis</i> was shot-slewed to one side.
      It is not an easy mark, that black, three-cornered hole, and thus far
      Midshipman Fanning has missed. It is now that success crowns his work; a
      smoking, spitting hand-grenade goes cleanly through, and fetches up on the
      <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo;s lower gun deck. The explosion instantly occurs; it is as
      though the fuse were carefully timed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were all it would be bad enough, but worse comes with it. There
      are scores of cartridges cumbering the deck to the rear of the batteries;
      for the powder monkeys of the <i>Serapis</i>, earning their pay and
      allowances, have been bringing powder from the magazines much faster than
      the gunners can burn it in their eighteen-pounders. The exploding
      hand-grenade sets off this powder. There is a blinding sheet of flame; a
      report like smothered thunder; the deck of the <i>Serapis</i> is all but
      torn from its timbers! Fifty of the crew are killed or crippled, while the
      slewed hatch-cover is blown overboard. No trouble now to hit that yawning
      black hatchway. With such a target there can be no talk of missing, and
      Midshipman Fanning and gunner Gardner, from their high perch on the main
      topsail yard, fill the stomach of the <i>Serapis</i> with a bursting,
      death-dealing shower. And so the end comes tapping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Mayrant, with his boarding party, stands waiting the signal.
      Commodore Paul Jones notes the devastation wrought by Midshipman Fanning&rsquo;s
      hand-grenades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boarders away!&rdquo; he cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Mayrant and his men go swarming over the hammock nettings of
      the <i>Serapis</i>, the red Indian port-fire, Anthony Jeremiah, among the
      foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lieutenant Mayrant reaches the deck of the <i>Serapis</i>, an English
      sailor thrusts him through the thigh with a pike. Lieutenant Mayrant
      shoots the pikeman though the heart. The latter falls dead, pike rattling
      along the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember Portsea jail, lads!&rdquo; shouts Lieutenant Mayrant, as he strides
      limpingly across the body of the dead pikeman. &ldquo;Remember Port-sea jail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nine in ten of the boarding party are of those ones exchanged at Nantes.
      With savage cries, they shout back, &ldquo;Remember Portsea jail!&rdquo; and the work
      of their vengeance is begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones has his eyes on Lieutenant Mayrant and his boarders.
      His attention is claimed by orderly Jack Downes, who plucks him by the
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir!&rdquo; says orderly Jack Downes. &ldquo;Captain Landais with the <i>Alliance</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the <i>Alliance</i> for a second time has crept down upon
      them, unnoticed in the heat and absorbing fury of the fray. The consort
      ship is wearing across the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s bows. What will Landais do?
      Does he come as friend or foe? The Frenchman has his answer ready, and
      pours a broadside into the <i>Richard</i> as he crosses. Then he sheers
      off, and again heads for the open ocean. That coward broadside kills and
      wounds Master&rsquo;s Mate Caswell and seven men. Commodore Paul Jones is rigid
      with rage and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is mad!&rdquo; says Lieutenant Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand!&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;There is still his
      crew! Why don&rsquo;t they clap him in irons, or cut him down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a shout from the deck of the <i>Serapis</i>. Captain Pearson, his
      last hope gone, has struck his colors with his own hand. The shout is from
      the wounded Lieutenant Mayrant, who hails Lieutenant Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop the firing, sir,&rdquo; cries Lieutenant May-rant, for the Richard&rsquo;s
      top-men are still blazing away merrily. &ldquo;He has struck his flag. Come on
      board, and take possession!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale leaps to the deck of the beaten <i>Serapis</i>. He sends
      Captain Pearson aboard the <i>Richard</i>. Downcast, eye full of
      dejection, Captain Pearson approaches Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;With bowed
      head, saying never a word, he tenders the conqueror his sheathed sword.
      Commodore Paul Jones takes it and gives it to Midshipman Potter, who is at
      his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your sword, Captain,&rdquo; says Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;And I bear
      testimony that you have worn it to the glory of the English navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Pearson makes no response. Bowed of head, mute of lip, he stands
      before Commodore Paul Jones, despair eating his heart.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;DIPLOMACY AND THE DUTCH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ommodore Paul
      Jones goes aboard the beaten <i>Serapis</i>. &ldquo;Cut free that sta&rsquo;board
      anchor!&rdquo; he cries. The piled dead and wounded are lifted aside, and that
      fatal anchor, which for two hours of blood has been as the backbone of
      battle, goes splashing into the ocean. The ships rock apart; as they
      separate, Commodore Paul Jones takes a sharp survey of the <i>Richard</i>.
      The survey brings little hope; his good ship that has fought so well for
      him lies in the water four smothering feet below its trim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are eight feet of water in the hold,&rdquo; replies Lieutenant Dale, whom
      he hails. &ldquo;The pumps choke; there&rsquo;s no chance to save the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then arises a sudden rending and tearing aboard the <i>Serapis</i>; there
      is a great swish! and a snapping of cordage. It is the mainmast crashing
      to port, a tangle of ropes and spars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; says a voice at the elbow of Commodore Paul Jones. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      have had it down an hour ago, but there was neither wind nor swell to help
      me. I had to cut it in two shot by shot to drop it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones breaks into a smile. &ldquo;Ah, yes; I remember, Mr.
      Lindthwait! I set you at that mainmast with the three long nines. I wish
      now that I&rsquo;d given you another target. However, you did extremely well. It
      should teach you, too, my lad, that a nine is as good as an eighteen, if
      you&rsquo;ll only go close enough. That&rsquo;s it; there&rsquo;s the whole secret of
      success in war. Be sure and go close enough, and you will conquer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Midshipman Lindthwait salutes respectfully, and lays away that golden rule
      of the battle art in his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal of the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s wounded is begun. The calm, windless
      sea assists; at last no one is left aboard the shot-pierced <i>Richard</i>
      but the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty lionhearts, who gave their lives for victory, are laid side by side
      on the deck. The petticoat flag flies proudly from the ensign gaff.
      Commodore Paul Jones, from the deck of the <i>Serapis</i>, watches the <i>Richard</i>
      to the last. The tears dim his sight, and he is driven more than once to
      dash them away; for a sailor loves his ship as though it were a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Richard</i> settles by the head; the stern is lifted clear of the
      water. Then, as though seized by some impulse, the <i>Richard</i>, bows
      first, dives for the bottom of the sea. The last that is seen, as the
      stout old ship goes down, is the virgin petticoat flag of the pretty
      Portsmouth girls. Commodore Paul Jones, bare of head, tears blinding his
      eyes, waves a last farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my lads!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;And you, too, my <i>Richard</i>;
      good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Pallas</i> comes up, breeze aft. The little ship throws its head
      into the wind, and Captain Cot-tineau hails Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor, sir,&rdquo; says Captain Cottineau, &ldquo;to report the enemy&rsquo;s
      surrender of his ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Cottineau points with his speaking-trumpet to the <i>Countess of
      Scarboro</i> a furlong astern, the stars and stripes above the Union Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones congratulates Captain Cottineau, and tells him to
      make sail for Dunkirk with his prize. Captain Cottineau, observing the
      helpless <i>Serapis</i>, its deck a jungle of cordage and broken timbers,
      replies that if Commodore Paul Jones doesn&rsquo;t mind he&rsquo;d sooner stand by.
      Commodore Paul Jones doesn&rsquo;t mind, and so Captain Cottineau, with the <i>Pallas</i>
      and the captured Scarboro stands by. The loyalty of Captain Cottineau
      flushes the bronzed cheek of Commodore Paul Jones. It is a change from the
      villain Landais! Ah, yes! Landais! The brow of Commodore Paul Jones turns
      black with anger; for a moment he forgot the scoundrel. He runs his glass
      along the horizon to seaward. There is no sign of the Alliance. Long ago
      the traitor Landais turned his recreant bows for France.
    </p>
    <p>
      An off-shore gale springs up; adrift and helpless, the <i>Serapis</i> is
      carried seventy miles towards the coast of Norway. This is fortunate; it
      carries the ship outside the search of those twenty frigates and ships of
      the line, which are already furiously ransacking the English coast in
      quest of Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind veers to the southwest, and blows a hurricane. The Serapis is all
      but thrown upon the coast of Denmark, and has work to keep afloat. With
      one hundred and six wounded, and the dead who went down with the <i>Richard</i>,
      Commodore Paul Jones is short of hands to work his ship. At the best, no
      more than one hundred and fifty are fit for duty. In the end the battered
      <i>Serapis</i> makes the Texel, and a common sigh of relief goes up from
      those seven hundred and twelve souls&mdash;crew and wounded and prisoners&mdash;who
      are aboard the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Commodore Paul Jones must lay aside his sword for chicane, abandon
      his guns in favor of diplomacy. His anchors are hardly down in Dutch mud,
      before Sir Joseph Yorke, English Ambassador to Holland, demands the <i>Serapis</i>
      from the Dutch authorities. Also, he declares that they must arrest
      Commodore Paul Jones &ldquo;as a rebel and a pirate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch display a wish to argue the case with Sir Joseph, while
      Commodore Paul Jones double-shots his guns and runs them out; for much in
      the way of repairs has been effected aboard the <i>Serapis</i>, and
      although it can&rsquo;t sail it can fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Joseph, at the grinning insolence of the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo; broadsides&mdash;ports
      triced up and muzzles showing&mdash;almost falls in an apoplectic fit.
      Purple as to face, he sends a second time to the Dutch, to learn whether
      or no he is to have the <i>Serapis</i> and the rebel and pirate Paul
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five days the Dutch drink beer, smoke pipes, and think the matter
      over. Then they tell Sir Joseph that, while they don&rsquo;t know what to call
      Commodore Paul Jones, they have decided not to call him a pirate. Rebel,
      he may be; but in that role of rebel King George and Sir Joseph must catch
      him for themselves. The most the Dutch will do is order the <i>Serapis</i>
      to leave the Texel. At this the empurpled Sir Joseph becomes more
      empurpled than ever. It is the best he can get, however; and since, during
      the night, a fleet of British men of war, hearing of the whereabouts of
      Commodore Paul Jones, have invested the mouth of the Helder and are
      waiting for him to come out, he begins to be a trifle comforted. If the
      Dutch will but drive the &ldquo;rebel&rdquo; from the port, it should do nicely; the
      English fleet outside will snap him up at a mouthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones refuses to be driven out. He sits stubbornly by his
      anchors, decks cleared, guns shotted, boarding nettings up&mdash;an insult
      to the purple Sir Joseph and a frowning defiance to the Dutch! The Dutch
      and Sir Joseph look at him, and then at each other. They agree that he is
      either the most exasperating of rebels, or the most insolent of pirates,
      or the most impertinent of guests, according to their various standpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the French Ambassador is bestirring himself. He makes a
      stealthy visit to Commodore Paul Jones. The French king has sent him,
      post-haste, a commission as Captain in the French marine. The French
      Ambassador tenders the commission. Upon accepting it, Commodore Paul Jones
      can run up the French flag. The Dutch will respect the tri-color, and
      there will come no more orders for the <i>Serapis</i> to quit the Texel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones declines the French commission. Neither will he run
      up the French flag. &ldquo;I am an officer of the American Navy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and
      the French tri-color no more belongs at my masthead than at General
      Washington&rsquo;s headquarters. I shall stand or fall by the Stars and Stripes.
      Also, here at the Texel I stay, until I&rsquo;m ready to leave; that I say in
      the teeth of Dutchman and Englishman alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this hardy note goes ashore, the Dutch look solemn, Sir Joseph
      retires with the gout, while the English outside the mouth of the Hel-der,
      stand oft and on, gnashing their iron teeth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;NOW FOR THE TRAITOR LANDAIS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the Dutch and
      Sir Joseph are debating as to whether Commodore Paul Jones is a rebel, a
      pirate or a disagreeable guest, that gentleman discovers Landais, with the
      Alliance, tucked away in a corner of the Texel. Headwinds, and an overplus
      of English on the high seas, have forced the miscreant into the Helder,
      and he finds himself as much cooped up as does Commodore Paul Jones.
      Indeed the miserable Landais is in a far more serious predicament; for,
      aside from the English outside, waiting at the Helder&rsquo;s mouth like
      terriers at a rat-hole, the formidable Paul Jones is inside with him, and
      Landais fears the latter as no Frenchman ever feared the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alarms of Landais are well grounded; Commodore Paul Jones opens
      negotiations at once. He sends word to Landais to give command of the <i>Alliance</i>
      to Lieutenant Degge, and at once leave the ship. The word is supplemented
      by the assurance that at the end of twenty-four hours he, Commodore Paul
      Jones, shall come aboard the Alliance. Should he then find Landais, he
      will be put in irons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not arrest the scoundrel at once?&rdquo; pleads Lieutenant Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Frenchman, Dick,&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones, &ldquo;and I fear to
      worry Doctor Franklin.&rdquo; Then, assuming a look of cunning, vast and deep:
      &ldquo;Wait until my diplomacy unfolds itself. You will find that I have the
      wisdom of the serpent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale grunts disgustedly. He cares nothing for the wisdom of the
      serpent, less for any spun-glass diplomacy. What he wants is the Landais
      blood directly; and says as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;this murderer Landais killed Caswell with that
      last felon broadside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall forget nothing,&rdquo; returns Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of twenty-four hours, Commodore Paul Jones boards the <i>Alliance</i>.
      He finds Lieutenant Degge in command; the craven Landais has slipped
      ashore with all his belongings. Commodore Paul Jones is the last man he
      cares to face. The latter tells Lieutenant Degge to clap the irons on
      Landais, should he return, and signal the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand, sir,&rdquo; responds Lieutenant Degge, &ldquo;that my crew is
      honeycombed with mutiny. Captain Landais brought about a conspiracy;
      two-thirds of the ship&rsquo;s company are in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me out a list of the leaders, and muster them aft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Degge gives Commodore Paul Jones the names of twenty. These are
      called aft&mdash;lowering and sullen. Commodore Paul Jones orders them
      transferred to the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you an even number to take their places,&rdquo; he says to Lieutenant
      Degge. &ldquo;Meanwhile, my old sea-wolves will lick them into patriotic shape.
      Should they fail, you may find some half dozen of the ringleaders at
      least, dangling from my yardarms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The caitiff Landais, driven from his ship, fumes and blusters. He tries to
      see the French Ambassador, and is refused. Then he sends a challenge to
      Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale finds the latter mariner in his cabin, blandly triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he cries, tossing the Landais challenge over to Lieutenant Dale&mdash;&ldquo;there,
      Dick, read that! You will then see what I meant by telling you to wait
      until my diplomacy had had time to unfold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to fight the creature?&rdquo; and Lieutenant Dale glances up
      from his reading, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight him; and kill him, sir! Why not? Do you suppose for a moment that
      poor Caswell is to go unavenged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think what you do! You can&rsquo;t fight this fellow! The man is to be
      court-martialed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, Dick! But observe; I&rsquo;ve as yet refrained from making formal
      charges against him. So far as the books go, he rates as well as you or
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones gets this off with inexpressible slyness, as one who
      discloses the very heart of his cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my dear Commodore,&rdquo; returns Lieutenant Dale, desperately, &ldquo;the thing
      is impossible! This Landais is not a gentleman! He is the commonest of
      blacklegs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick! Dick!&rdquo; remonstrates Commodore Paul Jones; &ldquo;you do him an injustice!
      Technically at least you wrong him. You should summon up more fairness.
      Now, here is how I look at it:&rdquo; Commodore Paul Jones grows highly
      judgmatical. &ldquo;I follow the law, which says that a man is supposed to be
      innocent until he&rsquo;s shown to be guilty. Influenced by this, which to my
      mind breathes the very spirit of justice, I make it an unbreakable rule,
      in matters of the duello, to regard every man as a gentleman unless the
      contrary has been explicitly demonstrated. No, Dick&rdquo;&mdash;this solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;Landais,
      whatever you or I may privately think, has still his rights. I shall fight
      him, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones sends Lieutenant May-rant ashore, as his
      representative, to accept the Landais challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have sent you, Dick,&rdquo; he explains to Lieutenant Dale, who
      inclines to the cloudy because he had been slighted; &ldquo;but, to tell the
      truth, I couldn&rsquo;t trust you. Yes; you&rsquo;d have cut in between us, and fought
      him in my stead. And the fact is, if you must have it, I&rsquo;ve set my heart
      on killing the rogue myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Mayrant finds Landais, vaporing and blustering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pistols; ten paces,&rdquo; says Lieutenant May-rant. &ldquo;Time and place you may
      settle for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pistols!&rdquo; exclaims Landais, his face a muddy gray. Pistols and Paul Jones
      mean death. With a gesture, as though dismissing an unpleasant thought, he
      cries: &ldquo;I shall not fight with pistols! They are not recognized in Prance
      as the weapons of a gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in America,&rdquo; retorts Lieutenant Mayrant. &ldquo;Neither shall you
      palter or split hairs! Pistols it shall be; or I tell you frankly that the
      officers of the <i>Serapis</i>, ay! the very foc&rsquo;sel hands, will beat you
      and drub you for a cowardly swab, wherever they come across you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Landais does not respond directly to this. He walks up and down,
      stomaching the hard words in silence. For he perceives, as through an open
      window, that the hidden purpose of Lieutenant Mayrant is to pick a quarrel
      with him. At last Landais makes it clear that under no compulsion will he
      fight with pistols. Neither will he give the hopeful Mayrant an opening to
      edge in a challenge for himself. After a fruitless hour the latter, sad
      and depressed, returns aboard the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could have been handled more delicately,&rdquo; he reports to Commodore
      Paul Jones; &ldquo;but, do my best, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t coax the rascal to the
      field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Lieutenant Dale, making a flimsy excuse about wishing to see
      the French secretary, goes ashore. He is using a crutch; for, like
      Lieutenant Mayrant, he was wounded in the battle. He finds the crutch
      inexpressibly convenient. Having hunted down Landais, whom he finds in a
      change house, he uses it to belabor that personage, giving him the while
      such descriptives as &ldquo;dog!&rdquo; &ldquo;spy!&rdquo; &ldquo;liar!&rdquo; &ldquo;coward!&rdquo; The heavy Dutchmen,
      quaffing their beer, interfere to save Landais from the warlike Lieutenant
      Dale. That night Landais starts post for Paris, to the mighty
      disappointment of Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you wanted to see the French secretary. It wasn&rsquo;t fair of
      you, Dick!&rdquo; is all Commodore Paul Jones says, when he learns of the doings
      of Lieutenant Dale and his crutch in the change house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; grumbles Lieutenant Dale defensively, &ldquo;so I did want to see the
      French secretary; although I&rsquo;ve now forgotten what it was all about. The
      sight of that dastard drove it from my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French Ambassador again boards the <i>Serapis</i>. He bears orders
      from De Sartine, the French Minister of Marine, and a letter from Doctor
      Franklin, full of suggestions which have the force of orders. The <i>Pallas</i>
      is a French ship, and the <i>Scarboro</i> captured by it, is a French
      prize. The <i>Serapis</i>, prize to the <i>Richard</i>, also a French
      ship, is by the same token a French prize. The French flag must be hoisted
      on these ships, and the trio made over to the French Ambassador. The <i>Alliance</i>,
      an American built ship, the King of France doesn&rsquo;t claim. He recommends,
      however, that it run up French colors, as a diplomatic method of quieting
      Dutch excitement, which is slowly but surely rising. Doctor Franklin&rsquo;s
      letter sustains the French claim to the <i>Pallas</i>, the <i>Scarboro</i>
      and the <i>Serapis</i>. He leaves Commodore Paul Jones to settle flags for
      the <i>Alliance</i> as he may deem best. The Ambassador makes, in this
      connection, a second tender of a Captain&rsquo;s commission in the French Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; responds Commodore Paul Jones bitterly, &ldquo;I shall not accept it. King
      Louis shall have the <i>Serapis</i>, the <i>Pallas</i> and the <i>Scarboro</i>
      since Doctor Franklin so orders. The <i>Alliance</i> and I, however, shall
      remain American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones gives the French Ambassador possession of the <i>Serapis</i>.
      Also, he waxes sarcastic, and intimates that it is the only way by which
      the French could have gotten the <i>Serapis</i> into their hands. This
      piece of wit does him no good, when later he asks it back from De Sartine.
      Sullen and dogged, he prepares to go aboard the Alliance, and orders the
      crew of the <i>Serapis</i> to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the French Ambassador interferes. What French subjects are on the
      musters of the Alliance and <i>Serapis</i> must be left in his charge.
      Commodore Paul Jones is to have none but Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this some sixty Danes speak up. They may not be Americans, but at least
      they are not French. Making this announcement, the gallant Scands refuse
      the orders of the French Ambassador, and pack their kits for the <i>Alliance</i>.
      These Danes are of the true viking litter, with yellow hair and steel-gray
      eyes. Their action comes like balm to the sore heart of Commodore Paul
      Jones. Later when he musters his reorganized crew aboard the <i>Alliance</i>,
      and makes them a brief talk, he speaks of the desertion of the French. He
      is interrupted by a youth&mdash;small and light and delicate. The youth
      steps out from among the sailors, and with him come four others. The youth
      bows half-way to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says&mdash;&ldquo;no, Monsieur le Commodore, not all the French have
      desert. I, Pierre Gerard, am still with you&mdash;I, and my four bold
      comrades, who are brave men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wants to stay, sir,&rdquo; vouchsafes Boatswain Jack Robinson, coming
      forward to the aid of little Pierre and his companions. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so, d&rsquo;ye see,
      since I always likes to encourage zeal, I stows &lsquo;em away in the long boat
      till that frog-eatin&rsquo; Ambassador is over the side. An&rsquo; so, here they be,
      game as pebbles, an&rsquo; a credit to the sta&rsquo;board watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All his prisoners and wounded have been put ashore, under arrangements
      with the Dutch and the gouty Sir Joseph. Aboard the <i>Alliance</i>,
      Commodore Paul Jones finds himself at the head of four hundred and twelve
      war-hardened wolves of the sea, American blood to a man, all save the
      sixty vikings, and little Pierre with his four.

      CHAPTER XX&mdash;AIMEE ADELE DE TELISON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is Christmas
      day. Out of the furious southwest blows a storm. The English ships,
      guarding the mouth of the Helder, are driven from their stations, and
      carried far out to sea. Tired of the Texel, with its French and English
      and Dutch, Commodore Paul Jones, taking advantage of the English scudding
      seaward before the gale, runs out with the <i>Alliance</i>, and lays her
      nose for the English coast, in the very face of the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being Christmas day, when Commodore Paul Jones puts the Dutch coast
      astern, there is plum duff and double grog aboard the <i>Alliance</i>.
      These, and the blue water beneath their fore-foot, mightily cheer the
      hearts of the crew. The exuberance takes shape in a way grateful to the
      soul of Commodore Paul Jones. A missive, borne by the tarry hand of
      Boatswain Jack Robinson, finds him during the larboard watch. As Boatswain
      Robinson rolls aft, the whole crew follow him, a respectable distance in
      the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deppytation,&rdquo; explains Boatswain Robinson, pulling his forelock&mdash;&ldquo;a
      deppytation of the entire ship&rsquo;s company down to cooks an&rsquo; cabin-boys, an&rsquo;
      be dammed to &lsquo;em! They sets forth their views in a round robin, which I
      hereby tenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatswain Robinson holds out a square of dingy bown paper. It is signed by
      every member of the crew, beginning with the redoubtable Robinson.
      Commodore Paul Jones reads the round robin, which is written in black
      sprawling characters, while Lieutenant Dale who comes up holds a ship&rsquo;s
      lantern. Thus runs the document, the compilation whereof has exhausted the
      forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We respectfully request you, sir, to lay us alongside any single-decked
      English ship to be found in these seas, or any double-decked ship under a
      fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; says Commodore Paul Jones, when he finished reading the round
      robin, &ldquo;this is what I like. Our ship is a thirty-six, our biggest gun a
      twelve-pounder. You say &lsquo;lay her alongside a fifty gun ship, with her
      lower tier of eighteen-pounders. I promise that I&rsquo;ll do my best. I&rsquo;ll
      cruise between St. George&rsquo;s Channel and the Bay of Biscay two full weeks,
      looking for what you ask. Still, I must tell you that, while I&rsquo;ve plenty
      of hope, I&rsquo;ve little expectation. This is winter weather, lads, and the
      chances of our finding a fight are slim. If we find one, however, I shall,
      by way of compliment, take you over the Englishman&rsquo;s hammock nettings
      myself; for I hold you, man and boy, to be as stout a crew as ever primed
      pistol or laid cutlass to grindstone, and one that it&rsquo;s an honor to lead.
      Mr. Bo&rsquo;sen, pipe the men for&rsquo;ard. Mr. Dale will give orders for another
      ration of grog all&rsquo;round. And so, shipmates, I give you a Merry
      Christmas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Alliance</i> goes looking for a British fifty. But nothing comes of
      it. Between wind and snow and biting weather, the ships have deserted the
      open ocean, like wild fowl, for the friendly sheltering warmth of the
      ports. When the two weeks are up, four weeks more are added to the cruise
      by common consent. Stores, however, are running low, and following six
      weeks futile looking about, Commodore Paul Jones stands in for the Isle au
      Grroaix, and anchors in the harbor of l&rsquo;Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is February fourteenth, the day of sweet St. Valentine. Also, it is
      among the coy and blushing possibilities, that sweet Saint Valentine has
      been lying in wait for him; for our sailor, home from sea, finds in the
      hands of his agent a pretty note, which in its sequence is to carry him
      into the midst of much tenderness and flowery happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note is from his good friend, the Marchioness de Marsan. The
      Marchioness asks Commodore Paul Jones, when he is next in l&rsquo;Orient and can
      spare himself from his ship, to visit her at her palace. Weary with the
      sea, sore from the loss of the <i>Serapis</i>, the summons falls in with
      his tired humor. He leaves the <i>Alliance</i> in charge of Lieutenant
      Dale, and goes with what haste he may to his friend the Marchioness. That
      good noblewoman kisses him on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for your victory!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;France is a-quiver with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Commodore Paul Jones is about to reply, a girl of twenty enters the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aimee de Telison, Commodore,&rdquo; says the Marchioness, presenting him. Then
      aside: &ldquo;She is my ward&mdash;my godchild! Is she not beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! Skin pink and white! Teeth like pearls or rice! Damask lips,
      eyes deep and lustrous and large! Hair a flood of red gold! In form a
      little rounded goddess! Beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus run the thoughts of the sailor, as the sweetness and witchery of the
      vision carries his senses along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aimee de Telison!&rdquo; he repeats in a whisper. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marchioness hesitates; then she returns in the same guarded tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she? She is the daughter of a King.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>resently the
      beautiful Aimee quits the room, and the good Marchioness de Marsan tells
      her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is surely no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t know, my dear Commodore,&rdquo; she
      says; &ldquo;since all France knows. Aimee&rsquo;s mother is of the de Tiercelins&mdash;a
      noble house, but impoverished. As a girl the mother was ravishingly
      lovely. This was in the days of Monsieur le Bel and the Parc-aux-Cerfs.
      The old king saw Mademoiselle de Tiercelin; the Pompadour did not object.
      Aimee was born; and presently her mother, whom the king called his &lsquo;de
      Bonneval,&rsquo; was put away with a pension. The Bonneval&rsquo;s father talked
      loudly, and was sent to the Bastile as a &lsquo;Russian spy.&rsquo; One may say what
      one will in the Bastile; the walls are thick and have no ears. The
      Pompadour looked after poor de Bonneval and the little Aimee. She married
      the mother to a gentleman named Telison. The Pompadour died; the king
      died; Aimee was sixteen. Her stepfather de Telison, and her mother de
      Bonneval neglected her. They said &lsquo;She is a Bourbon. Let the Bourbons
      provide.&rsquo; So I, who am her godmother, took Aimee. That was four years ago;
      and now it is as though she were my own child in very fact&mdash;I love
      her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the present king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus far he has done nothing for Aimee. She goes to court; her position
      is recognized; the king is kind. But you know the cold Savoy blood?&mdash;it
      is stingy! However, that is now of little moment so far as Aimee is
      concerned, for I am rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones is established at the palace of the good Marsan.
      Sailors are swift to love; the image of Aimee fits into his heart as into
      a niche that was made for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day he calls on the Duchess de Chartres&mdash;the beautiful
      girl-Duchess. He wears a guilty feeling at the base of his conscience.
      Fortunately his cheek is tanned by wind and weather, and the guilty
      feeling does not show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess is with her husband, the Duke de Chartres, who has quit
      the sea for the shore, his man-of-war for his palace. The girl-Duchess
      receives Commodore Paul Jones in something of a formal manner, which is a
      relief to him. His manner is also formal, which is not a relief to her.
      The Duke, who makes a specialty of democracy, greets him with bluff
      cordiality as a brother sailor. He congratulates him on beating the
      &ldquo;English dogs,&rdquo; whom he hates professionally. Commodore Paul Jones is
      modest in his replies. For he is not thinking of the <i>Serapis</i>, but
      on Aimee; and, with the eyes of the girl-Duchess upon him, that guilty
      feeling overlays all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl-Duchess watches him through halfshut lids. She almost guesses the
      truth; for she knows of the good Marsan, and Aimee. Besides, she is a
      woman, and clairvoyant in matters of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour with the Duke and the girl-Duchess, Commodore Paul Jones
      goes back to the good Marchioness de Marsan and to Aimee. As an excuse for
      his own idleness, he travels down to l&rsquo;Orient and, albeit the <i>Alliance</i>
      is as fit as a fiddle, sets Lieutenant Dale, &ldquo;Dick the practical,&rdquo; to
      overhauling the ship from truck to keel. Then he returns to the good
      Marsan and Aimee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he spends sunny hours in the beautiful Aimee&rsquo;s company, and his love
      creeps and grows upon him like ivy on a wall. The conqueror is conquered;
      the invincible is overthrown. As for Aimee, her blue eyes become a deeper
      blue, her pink cheeks take on a warmer pink when he is near. And the good
      Marsan sees it all, and does not interfere. For she is versed in the world
      and its ways; and this is France; and after life comes death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ardent sailor would be too ardent, Aimee represses him; the
      barrier of her modesty is as a barrier of ice between them. Thereupon he
      loves her the more, and refreshes his soul with Shakespeare:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Chaste as the icicle
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That&rsquo;s curdled by the frost of purest snow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And hangs on Dian&rsquo;s temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones goes down to l&rsquo;Orient again. Not so much to see after
      the <i>Alliance</i>, as to pique his love and give it edge. For absence
      makes the flame burn brighter, and Aimee bursts upon him with a new charm
      when he has been away.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all his lovelorn case, however, he makes arrangements for his two
      pets, Lieutenants May-rant and Fanning, to go privateering for the French,
      and gives them nearly one hundred and fifty of his fiercest sea-wolves to
      bear them company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why keep them rusting ashore,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;like good blades in their
      sheaths! No; let the lads sail forth with letters of marque, and make
      their fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Serapis</i> is held by the French as a king&rsquo;s prize, and de Sartine
      pays Commodore Paul Jones twelve thousand dollars as his share. There are
      other thousands from other prizes, and, after a French sort, he finds
      himself rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, following his visit to l&rsquo;Orient, he returns to the good Marsan, that
      estimable lady is discovered in a state of much excitement. The Duchess de
      Chartres has &ldquo;commanded&rdquo; the presence of Commodore Paul Jones at her
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect does not overcome him. He receives it with steadiness,
      although privily a-quake because of that feeling of guilt. The good
      Marsan&rsquo;s excitement is supplanted by wonder to see him take his honors so
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, these Americans!&rdquo; she thinks. Then, out loud: &ldquo;She is a Bourbon, my
      Commodore! No one below the blood royal has ever received such a summons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the uplifted palms of the good Marsan, her &ldquo;Commodore&rdquo; refuses
      to be impressed. He will go; since no one should decline the &ldquo;command&rdquo; of
      royalty. But he will go calmly&mdash;hiding of course his sense of guilt,
      and spreading the skirts of his conscience very wide to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aimee hears that he is to go, and cannot avoid a little flutter of alarm.
      She knows her beautiful kinswoman, the girl-Duchess&mdash;knows the spell
      and the power of her. It gives the tender Aimee a dull ache of the heart.
      A lone feeling of helplessness overwhelms her, as fears rise up for her
      poor love that, in so short a space, has become the one sweet thing in
      life. True, she herself is a Bourbon! But with the bar sinister. How then
      shall she, obscure and poor and by the left hand, hope to sustain herself
      in the heart of her lover against the wiles and siren wooings of one who
      is at once the most legitimate, the most beautiful, and the most wealthy
      woman in France! The tears gather in the soft eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Marsan goes from the room; for she has a deal of sympathy and
      good sense. Commodore Paul Jones, when now the two are alone, draws Aimee
      to him, and dries those tears in ways that lovers know. For the first time
      he folds her in his arms and kisses her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is also the last time,&rdquo; she thinks sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the gallant lover, as though he reads her thoughts, kisses her again,
      and vows by sword and ship to love her always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones finds the Duchess de Chartres in spirits. She and the
      Duke give him a suite of apartments that has heretofore been sacred to
      Bourbon occupation alone. At this the sensation that rocks the Court is
      profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It even reaches the rabbit-faced king&mdash;weak rather than dull&mdash;at
      Versailles, and gives him a shock. He draws down the uncertain corners of
      his undecided mouth, says naught, and goes out under the trees to feed his
      squirrels. He would be wiser were he to go out into the starved highways
      and byways of his oppressed realm, and feed his subjects. Did he do so, he
      might even yet avoid that revolution, which is slowly yet terribly
      preparing itself in the ante-chamber of Time.

      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;THE FÊTE OF THE DUCHESS DE CHARTRES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Duke and
      Duchess de Chartres give a grand banquet in honor of Commodore Paul Jones.
      The Duchess asks Doctor Franklin, whom she esteems, and calls &ldquo;Monsieur le
      Sage&rdquo; for his wisdom. Also, to please the worthy doctor, she has Madame de
      Houdetot, and the rest of his Passy friends, including the vivacious
      Madame Helvetius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; says the Duchess, who has weaknesses that favor washtubs&mdash;&ldquo;only
      I trust that our &lsquo;Rich Widow of Passy&rsquo; will wear a fresh frock, if only to
      give us something to, talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good Marsan and Aimee are among the guests. Indeed, it is to see Aimee
      and Commodore Paul Jones together that has caused the Duchess de Chartres
      to order the fête. She will bring the pair beneath her eyes&mdash;the
      young Aimee, and the &ldquo;Commodore,&rdquo; who has become formal. She will then
      know the best and worst of their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess is right in this assumption; for you may no more hide love
      than smoke. With half-watchfulness, she readily surprises their secret.
      Still she is gay and light; for her heart is the heart of a Bourbon, and
      the heart of your Bourbon is never a breakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seats Commodore Paul Jones on her right, which is the thing expected.
      Aimee is on his other hand; which last excites his suspicions&mdash;having
      that guilty feeling&mdash;while attracting the attention of nobody else.
      Over across is the wise Franklin, who finds himself vastly at home between
      the Houdetot and the rosy Helvetius, who is a marvel of tidiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess pays a deal of polite attention to Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think, my dear Commodore,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;how, with your ship on
      fire, and sinking under your feet, you had courage to continue the fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness forgets. To surrender would have meant a postponement
      of the bliss of meeting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Bayard himself,&rdquo; returns the Duchess, &ldquo;could have said nothing so
      knightly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aimee glows at this. In the face of her fears, she still likes to hear her
      lover-hero praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a promise!&rdquo; exclaims the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones reddens through the tan. What is coming! There is
      much of royal recklessness in the Duchess&rsquo; royal blood; she will now and
      then say a bold thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised,&rdquo; she goes on, &ldquo;to lay an English frigate at my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones is relieved. More, he is pleased, since the Duchess
      gives him a chance to be dramatic. He sends for his servant, who brings
      him a slim morocco case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness,&rdquo; he says, unbuckling the morocco case; &ldquo;I shall be
      better than my word. I lay at your feet, not a frigate truly, but a
      forty-four gun ship of two decks. Here is the token of it&mdash;the sword
      of as brave a sailor as ever sailed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones presents the Duchess with the vanquished sword of
      Captain Pearson, which he has taken from the morocco case. The Duchess,
      who has not foreseen this return to her sally, is deeply stirred. She
      receives the sword, and presses the gold scabbard to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dear to me as the sword of a conquered Englishman!&rdquo; she cries,
      turning with swimming eyes upon the company. &ldquo;It is doubly dear when it
      comes from my Achilles of the ocean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a buzz of admiration about the tables. Aimee herself is in a
      dream of happiness; for she has alarms but no jealousies, and the glory of
      her lover is her glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the guests break up for departure, Doctor Franklin and Commodore
      Paul Jones have a word together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked for it,&rdquo; says the Doctor, &ldquo;and de Sartine leads me to think
      that, as soon as the ship is refitted, the king will give you the <i>Serapis</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones brightens to a sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do wonders with so stout a ship,&rdquo; he replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you may count on it,&rdquo; goes on the Doctor. &ldquo;Indeed, when I
      remember in what manner the French came by the <i>Serapis</i>, I cannot
      see how the king is to refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I get it, I&rsquo;ll put Dick Dale in command of the <i>Alliance</i>.
      There shall be no second Landais you may be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of the <i>Alliance</i>,&rdquo; returns the Doctor, &ldquo;I shall send it to
      America as soon as the overhaul is finished, with certain munitions of war
      I&rsquo;ve collected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones&rsquo; pulse begins to beat uneasily. Antony does not want
      to leave his Cleopatra. What the Doctor next says, sets him to renewed
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Dale might better take the <i>Alliance</i> across. You will be
      needed here, if we are to coax the king into giving you the <i>Serapis</i>.
      There will be time for the <i>Alliance</i> to return before the <i>Serapis</i>
      is refitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin tells how he has formally relieved Landais from all
      command, and ordered him to report to the Marine Committee in
      Philadelphia, on charges of cowardice and treason. Also, Commissioner
      Arthur Lee has been called home; Congress has become suspicious of his
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a greater traitor than Landais!&rdquo; cries Commodore Paul Jones
      heatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without expressing myself on that point,&rdquo; observes the Doctor, eye
      a-twinkle, &ldquo;the situation produced by Mr. Lee&rsquo;s recall, makes another
      reason why Dale should sail with the <i>Alliance</i> and you stay here.
      Mr. Lee, I understand, has decided to take passage home in the <i>Alliance</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is the next day; the Duchess summons Commodore Paul Jones to the
      morning-room, where she sits alone in the spring sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love is like your ship, my friend,&rdquo; she observes. &ldquo;It goes voyaging
      from heart to heart, as the other does from port to port. No, not a word!
      I promise that you shall not break my heart. Come, I will show you what
      makes me safe&mdash;safe even from that terrible heart-rover and
      sea-rover, that buccaneer of the ocean and of love, the invincible Paul
      Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiles; but there is that about the smile which reminds one of the
      hard glitter of a rapier. She rings a bell, says a low word, and presently
      a little round-faced boy is brought in. He is the baby son of the Duchess.
      Commodore Paul Jones has heard of the little boy; but this is his earliest
      glimpse of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a handsome child, and Commodore Paul Jones gazes upon him with
      admiration. The boy is to grow up and, fifty years later, sit on the
      French throne as the &ldquo;Citizen King.&rdquo; This, however, is a secret of the
      future, and neither the mother nor Commodore Paul Jones, as they look on
      the small, round face, is granted a least glint of it. Released by the
      nurse, little Louis Philippe toddles across to Commodore Paul Jones, pudgy
      hands outstretched. The latter catches him up and kisses him. At this the
      eyes of the Duchess soften with mother-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she remarks, and a sigh and a laugh struggle for precedence on her
      lips&mdash;&ldquo;See! he is like all of us. He loves you!&rdquo; She becomes grave.
      &ldquo;There is my resource!&rdquo; she goes on. &ldquo;My friend, I will let you into a
      secret. No man&rsquo;s treason, not though he be the bewildering Paul Jones&rdquo;&mdash;this
      with a tinge of wicked emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;can break a mother&rsquo;s heart. No; she
      takes refuge in her child, and finds his kisses sweeter than a lover&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She takes the boy out of his hands, and kisses the little face again and
      still again. Commodore Paul Jones says no word of protest, explanation or
      defence. The Duchess is taking her revenge; he knows it, and thinks her
      entitled to it. Moreover, he is beginning in his own heart to be relieved,
      and the guilty feeling that gnaws his conscience is sensibly dulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse returns and takes the boy. The Duchess gives the little face a
      last kiss. Then her glance comes back to Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;love your red-haired Aimee, since you love
      her; I can give you up; for even though you leave me, you leave me a
      Bourbon. And yet I feel a small jealousy&mdash;just a little stab! For
      that stab, my friend, you must pay. No one harms a Bourbon, and escapes
      unpunished.&rdquo; This is said half quizzically, half seriously. &ldquo;Yes, I shall
      have my revenge. I intend that you shall marry Aimee.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE WEDDING WITHOUT BELLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>octor Franklin
      journeys down to Lyons, on some secret errand of his own; he will be gone
      a week. Commodore Paul Jones, at home with the good Marsan, drunk with
      love, forgets the blue of the ocean in the blue of Aimee&rsquo;s eyes. One
      sun-filled afternoon he is disturbed by Lieutenant Dale, who stalks in
      with a scowl on his usually steady face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Dick?&rdquo; asks Commodore Paul Jones, alive in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something too deep for me, Commodore, or I shouldn&rsquo;t be here with the
      tangle. Commissioner Lee, with Landais, has taken the <i>Alliance</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as I say. Lee declares that Doctor Franklin had no authority to
      depose Landais. He, Lee, has restored him to command, and the pair have
      possession of the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did nothing. I&rsquo;m a sailor, and pretend to no knowledge of the limits of
      Mr. Lee&rsquo;s authority. Speaking for myself, I refused to serve with Landais;
      and Lieutenants Stack, McCarty and Lunt, and Midshipman Lindthwait did the
      same. We came ashore, and Bo&rsquo;sen Jack Robinson at the head of sixty of the
      crew came with us.&rdquo; Commodore Paul Jones, while Lieutenant Dale talks, is
      thinking. What is to be done! Manifestly nothing. Doctor Franklin is out
      of reach. Without the Doctor&rsquo;s authority no one can meddle with Arthur
      Lee, who still has his powers as a commissioner. Besides, there&rsquo;s the <i>Serapis</i>;
      it is only a question of weeks when he, Commodore Paul Jones, will be
      given its command. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Dale and the others can disport
      themselves ashore, as he does. Let Lee and Landais keep the <i>Alliance</i>,
      since they already have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done right, Dick,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Stay ashore then, and keep the lads
      together; we&rsquo;ll wait for the <i>Serapis</i>. Also, King Louis has given
      Doctor Franklin the <i>Ariel</i>, a ship-sloop the size of the old <i>Ranger</i>.
      When I take the <i>Serapis</i> to sea, Dick, you shall sail Captain of the
      <i>Ariel</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Dale goes his way, and Commodore Paul Jones returns to Aimee,
      pleased in secret to think he may continue unhindered to sun himself in
      her smiles. It grinds a bit to think of the &ldquo;dog Landais,&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;traitor Arthur Lee,&rdquo; in control of the <i>Alliance</i>. Still, all will
      come right; for is he not to have the <i>Serapis</i>? And while he waits,
      there is Aimee; and love is even sweeter than war. So he goes back to his
      goddess, with her deep eyes and red-gold hair, and puts such caitiff
      creatures as Lee and Landais outside his thoughts. It is for Congress to
      deal with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones is not permitted to forget Lee and Landais. Within
      the hour, he is again called from the side of Aimee by his friend Genet, a
      noble upperling in the French foreign office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to tell you,&rdquo; says Genet, &ldquo;that Captain Landais and Monsieur Lee
      have got the <i>Alliance</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are to sail in three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant Dale has told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not tell you that we have issued orders to Thevenard, who commands
      the forts at the barrier, to sink the <i>Alliance</i>, should she try to
      put to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sink the <i>Alliance</i>!&rdquo; Commodore Paul Jones is thunderstruck. &ldquo;My
      dear Genet, you jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No jest, my friend. The orders have been given. Should the <i>Alliance</i>
      attempt to pass the harriers, Thevenard will fire on it with all his
      hundreds of big guns, and snuff it out like a candle. It is by request of
      your Doctor Franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me that Doctor Franklin asks you to sink the <i>Alliance</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has asked us&mdash;for he had some inkling of the designs of Lee and
      Landais&mdash;to prevent them sailing away with the ship. We know of but
      one way to do that. We must sink it, since we have no ship here to arrest
      them. So we gave the orders to Thevenard. Those orders, however, we did
      not impart to Doctor Franklin; and, in good truth, I tell them to you now,
      not as a French official, but as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be stopped!&rdquo; cries Commodore Paul Jones, his habits of decision
      and iron promptitude reassumed in a moment. &ldquo;What! Sink two hundred brave,
      good men, to punish a pair of traitors? Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Genet, who makes a cult of red tape, shrugs his shoulders and spreads his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is Doctor Franklin&rsquo;s request. I cannot
      countermand the orders to Thevenard until he withdraws his request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see Thevenard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred and eighty miles in fifty-four hours! An unprecedented thing!
      And yet Commodore Paul Jones does it, and rides into l&rsquo;Orient in time to
      prevail on General Thevenard, who is his friend and his worshipper, to let
      the <i>Alliance</i> pass free. The forts would else have sunk the ship
      with their tons upon tons of metal. He saves the <i>Alliance</i> by a
      narrow margin of hours, and Lee and Landais shake out their sails for
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go to disgrace and grief,&rdquo; thinks Commodore Paul Jones, consoling
      himself for their escape. Then he considers how he has saved the lives of
      more than two hundred honest sailors, who have fought well for flag and
      country, and is consoled in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones is surrounded by surprises. He is met on the road,
      while returning to his Aimee, by a message from the Duchess de Chartres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come instantly to me!&rdquo; it says.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a look of mingled sorrow and resentment, with over all a hue of
      humor, on the Duchess&rsquo; bright face when she welcomes Commodore Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marchioness de Marsan and I have arranged it,&rdquo; she says, and her
      glance is wicked and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arranged what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your marriage, my friend! I congratulate you! You and your red-haired,
      blue-eyed one are to wed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, then!&rdquo; says he, turning wicked, too. Manlike, it
      offends his vanity that one who has pretended to love him so deeply should
      be now so ready to give him to another. &ldquo;I could wish no fairer fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wedding must be secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret! Believe me, I shall tell all France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ruin the blue-eyed one! Hear me, my Commodore&mdash;once my beloved,
      ever to be my friend! I have had a world of trouble in your affairs. I
      arranged with the Marsan; but only by agreeing that the marriage be buried
      in secrecy. You know much of the sea; little of the shore when all&rsquo;s said.
      Should the king hear of Aimee as your wife, he would drive her from
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why!&rdquo; and his cheek begins to burn angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that Aimee is a Bourbon,&rdquo; returns the Duchess, with a fashion
      of malicious satisfaction. He has deserted her for his Aimee; it is her
      revenge to irritate his pride. &ldquo;You are a valorous man, and the king makes
      much of you. Besides, you beat the English, whom he fears and hates. And
      yet he does not forget that you are a peasant&mdash;as I did. Marry Aimee,
      my friend&mdash;. marry a Bourbon, even a Bourbon by the left hand, and
      King Louis will bolt the doors of France in both your faces. Indeed, the
      Bastile might be the end of it for your Aimee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your royal highness sees unnecessary ghosts,&rdquo; he replies, with a
      sneer. Just the same, that linking of the Bastile and Aimee alarms him.
      &ldquo;Without pausing to question the king&rsquo;s powers touching Bastiles and
      French doors, I may tell you he has already heard that I love Aimee.
      Doctor Franklin, himself, told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love Aimee! Yes; love her as much and to what limit you will! The king
      will never resent that. But do not let the whisper that you have married
      Aimee reach the kingly ear. Can you not understand! Here, I will put it in
      the abstract. A Princess may have a <i>liaison</i> with a peasant, and in
      the shadow of that dishonor she will remain forever a Princess. Should the
      Princess, in some gust of virtue, be swept into a marriage with the
      peasant, she becomes instantly a peasant. It is one of those strange
      cases, my friend, where the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; is a stain and the word &lsquo;mistress&rsquo;
      no stain at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is midnight; two candles burn dimly on the altar of &ldquo;Our Lady of
      Loretto.&rdquo; The great chapel is dark and vacant; the feeble light does not
      reach the vaulted roof, and the groined arches disappear upward in a thick
      blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the altar stands a priest. Near the rail is gathered a group of four,
      the Duchess de Chartres, the good Marchioness de Marsan, Aimee&mdash;heart
      a-flutter, her pink cheeks hidden in a veil&mdash;and Commodore Paul
      Jones. The priest draws the Duchess aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness,&rdquo; he whispers, pleadingly, &ldquo;I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of whom, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king, your royal highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess makes an angry motion with her hand, while her little boot
      smites the stone floor and sends an echo through the room&rsquo;s vast
      emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Joseph, observe! You are my almoner. Through your hands I give
      fifty thousand louis to the poor of Paris, and keep you in fatness
      besides. It is I, not the king, whom you should fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, before the flickering altar candles, Commodore Paul Jones weds
      Aimee Adele de Telison. In the book which the Duchess and the good Marsan
      sign as witnesses, Father Joseph, with a pen that shakes a little, records
      the nuptials of &ldquo;Monsieur le Joignes and Mademoiselle Adele de Bonneval.&rdquo;
       For &ldquo;de Bonneval&rdquo; was the dead King&rsquo;s name for Aimee&rsquo;s mother in the days
      of Monsieur le Bel and the Parc-aux-Cerfs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THAT HONEYMOON SUB ROSA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Duchess kisses
      Aimee, and the good Marsan drives back to her palace with the blissful
      ones through the black midnight Paris streets. Commodore Paul Jones is in
      a trance of happiness. Aimee creeps into his arms and whispers &ldquo;Mon Paul,&rdquo;
       and the surrender of the <i>Serapis</i> is forgotten, as a thing trivial
      and transient, in the surrender of this girl with the glorious red-gold
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer runs away into autumn, and the brown tints of October show in the
      trees. The honeymoon has been one of secrecies and subterfuges, and
      perhaps the tenderer and sweeter because <i>sub rosa</i>. Commodore Paul
      Jones tears himself now and again from Aimee&rsquo;s arms to urge the business
      of the <i>Serapis</i>. He is seconded by Aimee, to whom his glory is as
      dear as his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Franklin tells the king that he should give Commodore Paul Jones
      the ship, and is referred to de Sartine. The oily minister slips away from
      the proposal, and the king sends Commodore Paul Jones a &ldquo;Sword of Honor&rdquo;
       and the title of &ldquo;Chevalier.&rdquo; The impatient sailor bites his lip, and
      gives the plaything sword to Aimee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked for a ship, not a sword,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;As for &lsquo;Chevalier,&rsquo; since I&rsquo;m
      already a Commodore, it looks like promotion down-hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king,&rdquo; explains Doctor Franklin, &ldquo;does not, I fear, forgive your
      refusal of his captain&rsquo;s commission when you lay at the Texel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he returns, &ldquo;continue to regard that offer of a commission as a
      piece of royal impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones determines to bring the king to a decision. He walks
      in the royal gardens with his ally, Genet, and comes upon the king feeding
      his interminable squirrels. The king&mdash;for democracy is becoming a
      fashion&mdash;greets Commodore Paul Jones with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not tell me,&rdquo; concludes the king, &ldquo;that you come for a ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to ask for the <i>Serapis</i>, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor king rubs his head, his vague lip twitches, while the unlocked
      jaw multiplies the feebleness of his weak face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chevalier, I cannot,&rdquo; he returns. In a tone of pathos, he continues:
      &ldquo;Congratulate yourself, my friend, that you are not a king. You would be
      compelled to have ministers, and they would make a slave of you&mdash;as
      they have of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; says Commodore Paul Jones, to Doctor Franklin. &ldquo;There is no
      hope of the <i>Serapis</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the <i>Ariel</i>, then, and return to Philadelphia,&rdquo; replies the
      Doctor. &ldquo;There is the <i>America</i>, seventy-four guns, building on the
      Portsmouth stocks. I&rsquo;ve written the Marine Committee to give you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones holds Aimee close. He kisses her dear lips. &ldquo;In the
      spring I shall return, my love,&rdquo; he promises. &ldquo;Three little months, and
      you are in my arms again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aimee whispers something, and then buries her face in his breast. The
      blush she is trying to hide spreads and spreads until it covers the back
      of the fair neck, and the red of it is lost in the roots of the red-gold
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cries in a burst of joy, holding her closer. &ldquo;Good! Now I shall
      have something to dream of and return to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a raw, flawy February day when Commodore Paul Jones lands in
      Philadelphia. Arthur Lee, with his poisonous mendacities, has preceded
      him. He is called before the Marine Committee, to reply to a list of
      questions, that in miserable effect amount to charges. Anger eating his
      heart like fire, he answers the questions, and is then voted a resolution
      of thanks and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing no other way, he seeks a quarrel with Arthur Lee, the fiery,
      faithful Cadwalader at his elbow. Mad Anthony Wayne, acting for him, meets
      Arthur Lee informally. The latter does not like the outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; exclaims Arthur Lee, inventing a defensive sneer. &ldquo;Either the
      son of a Scotch peasant or worse, and a man who has changed his name. By
      what right does such a person demand satisfaction of a gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to suggest,&rdquo; returns Mad Anthony, beginning to bristle, &ldquo;that I
      shall regard a refusal to fight, based on the ground you state, as a
      personal affront to myself. More; let me tell you, sir, that he who shall
      seek to bar Paul Jones from his plain rights, on an argument aimed at his
      gentility, will get nothing by his pains but the name of coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so!&rdquo; responds Arthur Lee, his sneer somewhat in eclipse at the
      stark directness of Mad Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know so, sir. When you speak of Paul Jones, you speak of the conqueror
      of the <i>Drake</i> and the <i>Serapis</i>. Also, when you deal with me,
      you deal with one who is the equal of any Lee of your family, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mad Anthony blows through his warlike nose ferociously, and Arthur Lee is
      silent. Meanwhile, the excellent Cadwalader, ever painstaking in matters
      of bloodshed, prepares a challenge, which he intends shall be a model for
      succeeding ages, when studying the literature of the duello.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at this pinch that the peace-loving Morris, helpless and a bit
      desperate, brings the weight of General Washington to bear upon the
      combative one. The &ldquo;Father of his Country&rdquo; succeeds where Mr. Morris has
      failed, and silences all talk of a duel. As a reward for that gentleman&rsquo;s
      eleventh-hour docility, he prevails upon Congress to give Commodore Paul
      Jones command of the half-built <i>America</i>, in accord with the request
      of Doctor Franklin, already in its dilatory hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones goes to Portsmouth to oversee the launching and the
      equipment of his new seventy-four. Disappointment dogs him; for Lord
      Cornwallis surrenders, and Congress, in a fit of foolish generosity,
      presents the America to France, as a slight expression of its thanks for
      the part she played in the capture of that English nobleman. Commodore
      Paul Jones sees his just-completed seventy-four, over which he has toiled
      like a poet over his verse, and wherein he was to presently sail away to
      conquer fresh honors for himself and his Aimee, hoist the French flag and
      receive a French captain on its quarter-deck. Steadying himself under the
      blow, with a grim philosophy which he has begun to cultivate, he goes back
      to Philadelphia. He finds letters from France awaiting him; one is from
      his Aimee, written in a tremulous, wavering hand. It must have borne
      wonderful news, for in his reply he says:

      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;CATHERINE OF RUSSIA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ommodore Paul
      Jones, nervously irritable with the loss of the <i>America</i>, asks leave
      of Congress to go as a volunteer with the French fleet, which hopes to
      find and fight the English in the West Indies. Congress consents, and he
      sails southward with Captain Vaudreuil, to fight yellow fever, not
      English, and return much shaken in health. As a solace and a recuperative,
      he sends divers cargoes of oil to Europe on a speculation, and makes forty
      thousand dollars. All the time he is pining to get back to Paris, his
      Aimee, the good Marsan, as well as Aimee&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s &ldquo;sweet little godson,&rdquo;
       that must &ldquo;be covered with kisses.&rdquo; He is detained by his accounts with
      the government and his claims for prize money. After heart-breaking
      delays, his affairs are adjusted; again he finds himself outward bound for
      France. His Aimee meets him with kisses sweet as heaven. He unlocks her
      white arms from his neck, and asks in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; she says, with a rush of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she carries him to a quiet cemetery, and, taking his hand, leads him
      to a little grave, upon which the new grass has not grown two weeks. There
      is a tiny headstone of pale granite, and on it the one word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gaze is long and steadfast as he holds fast by his Aimee&rsquo;s hand. Then
      his tears are united with hers; they stand bowed above the little grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones and his Aimee, while ever together, formally conceal
      the tie that binds them. He has business with the king about prize money;
      she has petitions before the king about the blood that is common to her
      veins and his; and both the good Marsan and Doctor Franklin say it is
      better that the king should not know. And so the king goes feeding his
      squirrels and forgetting his people, in ignorance of what took place on
      that midnight before the candle-lighted altar of Our Lady of Loretto. But
      the wise old world is not so thick, and winks and smiles and wags its wise
      old head; and whenever it passes a pretty cottage in the Rue Vivienne it
      points and whispers tolerantly. For the wise old world loves lovers; and
      because Aimee always officially resides with the good Marsan when her
      &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; is in Paris, and actually resides with that amiable gentlewoman
      when her &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; is in London, or Copenhagen, or elsewhere on the complex
      business of those prize moneys, no one finds fault. And so four years of
      love and truth and sweetness, four beautiful years, throughout which the
      birds sing and the sun shines always, come and go for Commodore Paul Jones
      and his Aimee; and every noble door in France swings open at their
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prize money gets into a tangle, and Commodore Paul Jones consults his
      friends, Mirabeau and the venerable Malesherbes. Then he visits America,
      and is feted and feasted, while his Aimee&mdash;each year rounder and
      plumper and more bewitching&mdash;with the red-gold hair growing ever
      redder and more golden&mdash;stays in Paris by the side of the good
      Marsan, and keeps a loving eye on the vine-clothed cottage in the Rue
      Vivienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can exceed the honors wherewith Commodore Paul Jones is stormed
      upon and pelted while in America. He is banqueted by the Morrises, the
      Livingstons, the Hamiltons, the Jays, while&mdash;what is more to his
      heart&rsquo;s comfort&mdash;he is visited by Dale and Fanning and Mayrant and
      Lunt and Stack and Potter and scores of his old sea wolves of the <i>Ranger</i>
      and <i>Richard</i>, who crowd round him to press his hand. In the end he
      drinks a last cup of wine at the Livingston Manor House, rides down to the
      foot of Cortlandt Street, and goes aboard the <i>Governor Clinton</i>,
      which, anchors hove short, awaits him. It is his last glass in America,
      his last glimpse of the shores for which he fought so valorously; November
      sees him in the Straits of Dover, nineteen days, out from Sandy Hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes to Paris, and the king has him to lunch at Versailles&mdash;a
      nine-days&rsquo; social wonder, the like of which has not been witnessed by a
      staring world since an elder Louis dined Jean Bart. The royal luncheon
      over, Commodore Paul Jones again settles down to the dear smiles and the
      love of his Aimee, while the aristocracy of France lionizes the one and
      worships the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mr. Jefferson, now America&rsquo;s Minister to Versailles, and greatly
      the friend of our two love birds, walks in upon them in that little
      vine-embowered cottage in the Rue Vivienne. He has big news. The Empress
      Catherine asks Commodore Paul Jones to become an admiral in the Russian
      navy. The Turks are troubling her; she wants him to sweep these turbaned
      pests from the Black Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheek of Commodore Paul Jones flushes, his eye lights up. Between love
      and war his heart was formed to swing like a pendulum. Now he has loved
      for a season, he would like nothing better than another game with those
      &ldquo;iron dice of destiny,&rdquo; <i>vide licet</i> cannon balls; and where should
      be found a fitter table than the Black Sea, or a more eligible adversary
      than the Turk? Thus it befalls that his Aimee goes to court with Madam
      Campan, the noble daughter of the noble Genet, and translates English
      plays into French for the amusement of Versailles; while be, hot of heart
      and high of head, as one who snuffeth the battle afar off, makes a
      straight wake for St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones meets the Empress Catherine in her Palace of
      Czarsko-Selo. Outside the snow lies thick; for it is April, and winter is
      ever reluctant to quit St. Petersburg. He is pricked of curiosity
      concerning this Russian Empress, for whom he is to draw his sword. He
      hopes&mdash;somewhat against hope, it is true, when he recalls her sixty
      years&mdash;that she will prove beautiful. For he is so much the knight of
      romance that he fights with more pleasure for a pretty face than for a
      plain one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Empress is before him; he can now put his hopes to the test. His eyes
      fall upon a thick, gross figure&mdash;a woman the antithesis of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth is coarse, her nose high and hawkish, her forehead full, her
      gaze hard and level, her whole face harsh&mdash;having been so often
      burned and swept of passion. And yet he feels the power of this white,
      fire-eyed savage, with her heart of a Phryne and her brain of a Henry the
      Eighth. There is so much that is palpable and brutish about her, however,
      that he stands off from her contact and remembers with regret his delicate
      Aimee of the red-gold locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Paul Jones has been too well trained as a courtier to let fall
      the polite mask which he wears, and nothing could be more elaborately
      suave than are the manners he assumes. The ferocious Catherine gets some
      glimmer of his inward thought for all that. Every inch the Empress, she is
      even more the woman. To the day of her death the unpardonable offence in
      any male of her species is a failure to fall in love with her. She
      receives some chilling touch of her new Admiral&rsquo;s aversion, and it turns
      her into angry ice. Still, if he will not sigh for her, he shall serve
      her: so she says to herself. He remains in St.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petersburg a fortnight; the Empress sees him more than once. When they are
      together, they talk of Potemkin, Suwarrow, the Turks, and the Black Sea.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;AN ADMIRAL OF RUSSIA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>dmiral Paul Jones
      travels to the mouth of the Dnieper and joins Potemkin, who is a military
      fool. Suwarrow, old and cunning and vigilant and war-wise, is another man.
      He goes aboard his flagship, the <i>Vladimir</i>, of seventy guns. From
      the beginning he is befriended by the grizzled Suwarrow and thwarted by
      the foppish Potemkin. This latter is a discarded favorite of Catherine;
      and, since she is very loyal to a favorite out of favor, he knows he may
      take liberties. Old Suwarrow, over his brandy, tells Potemkin&rsquo;s story to
      Admiral Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kept the Empress&rsquo; smiles for a season,&rdquo; explains Suwarrow; &ldquo;when all
      of a sudden, having seen Moimonoff, she fills Potemkin&rsquo;s pockets with gold
      and jewels, gives him a two-thousand-serf estate, and bids him &lsquo;travel,&rsquo;
      as she bid twenty of his predecessors travel. &lsquo;In what have I offended?&rsquo;
      whines Potemkin. &lsquo;In nothing,&rsquo; returns the Empress. &lsquo;I liked you
      yesterday; I don&rsquo;t like you to-day; that is all. So you see, my friend,
      that you can no longer stay in Petersburg, but must travel!&rsquo; This was ten
      years ago,&rdquo; continues old Suwarrow. &ldquo;Potemkin comes down here, and the
      Empress puts him in charge, and sustains him in all he says and does. My
      dear Admiral, you must get along with Potemkin to get along with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones is by no means sure that he must get along with
      Potemkin, and regrets that he quitted France, which holds his Aimee.
      However, being aboard the <i>Vladimir</i>, and having to his signal twenty
      ships, he resolves to strike one blow for the savage Catherine, if only to
      see how a Russian fights and what battering a Turk can stand. It will give
      him something to talk of, something by which he may compare the English
      and French and Americans, when next at his ease, with Genet or Jefferson
      or mayhap King Louis as a fellow conversationist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chance comes; Admiral Jones engages the Turkish fleet off Kinburn
      Head, and destroys it after sixteen hours&rsquo; fighting&mdash;sinking some,
      burning others, breaking completely the power of the Crescent. The Turks
      bear a loss of twenty-nine ships and more than three thousand sailors,
      while Admiral Paul Jones loses but three small ships. Having advantage of
      the victory, old Suwarrow brings his army across the Boug. At one blow,
      Admiral Paul Jones unlocks the Liman and throws it open to the victorious
      entrance of old Suwarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oczakoff falls; Admiral Paul Jones, sick of the cowardice and duplicity of
      Potemkin and his parasite Nassau-Siegen, relinquishes his command. He bids
      old Suwarrow good-bye, and travels in a manner of lordly leisure, not at
      all Russian, but particularly American, back to St. Petersburg and the
      Empress. As he bids farewell to old Suwarrow, the latter detains him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he takes from one of his camp chests a priceless cloak of sea-otter
      and sable, lined with yellow silk, and an ermine jacket, white as snow,
      set off with heavy gold frogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them, mon Paul,&rdquo; says the old soldier, pressing them upon Admiral
      Paul Jones. &ldquo;They are too fine for me.&rdquo; Here he looks complacently at his
      threadbare gray coat and muddy boots. &ldquo;No; were I to wear such feathers,
      my soldiers, who are my children, wouldn&rsquo;t know their old papa Suwarrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Empress receives Admiral Paul Jones in her palace of the Hermitage.
      She is affable, condescending, appreciative, and assigns him to command
      the naval forces in the Baltic. She makes him rich in gold; for, while the
      Empress will so far humor Potemkin as to remove Admiral Paul Jones out of
      his way, she will not fail of doubly rewarding that mariner for the
      victory which Potemkin is now trying to steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones grows dissatisfied, however. The Russian nobility
      intrigues against him, and de Segur, the French Minister, must come to his
      rescue. They steal his letters from Aimee; and, not hearing from his
      beloved, he becomes homesick. He tells the Empress that he must go; she
      consents when he promises to continue drawing full pay as Admiral. That
      agreed to, she allows him leave of absence for two years, and back he goes
      to Paris and his Aimee&rsquo;s arms. He calls on De Segur, the French Minister,
      before he starts, and thanks him for his friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will return?&rdquo; says De Segur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! I want no more of Russia and its Russians! What is this Court of
      Catherine, but a place where vilest purposes are arrived at by agencies
      most wretched, and artifices that should disgrace a dog? I am of an honor
      unfit for such a place, as silk is unfit for mire. The very people are
      without charity or a commonest humanity. They are like the wolves of their
      own forests; should they discover one of their brothers, wounded or
      stricken down, instead of offering aid, they would fall upon him&mdash;rending
      and devouring him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen long months! Sixteen dreary months you have been gone!&rdquo; says
      Aimee, when they are again together at the cottage in the Rue Vivienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are over, little one,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;over, never to return. Aside
      from being separated from you, which is to be separated from the sun&rdquo;
       &mdash;here he caresses her red-gold hair&mdash;&ldquo;they were the sixteen
      months most miserable of my life.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;THE HOUSE IN THE RUE TOURNON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now dawn many
      days of love and peace and plenty for Admiral Panl Jones, days in the
      midst of friends, glad days made sumptuous by a beautiful woman, who is a
      king&rsquo;s daughter crowned with a wealth of red-gold hair. He has his
      business, too, and embarks in speculation; wherein he shows himself as
      much a sailor of finance as of the sea. The imperial Catherine refuses to
      lose him; but pays to the last like an Empress, bidding him prolong his
      vacation while he will. He grows rich. He has twelve thousand pounds in
      the bank; while in America, Holland, Denmark, Belgium and England his
      interests flourish. He sells his plantation by the Rappahannock for
      twenty-five hundred dollars&mdash;less than a dollar an acre; for he says
      that he has no more heart to own slaves, and the plantation cannot be
      worked without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little happy cottage in the Rue Vivienne grows small; neither is it
      magnificent enough for his Aimee, of whom each day he grows more proud and
      fond. So he removes, bag and baggage, to a mansion in the Rue Tournon.
      There the rooms are grand, ceilings tall, fireplaces hospitably wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide fireplaces will do for winter; just now he swings a hammock in
      the back garden, which is thick-sown of trees and made pleasant by a
      plushy green May carpet of grass. Here he lolls and reads and receives his
      friends. For the careful Aimee counsels rest, and much staying at home;
      because he is a long shot from a hale man, having been broken with that
      fever in the West Indies, and in no wise restored by the mists and the
      miasmas of the Dnieper marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the summer the back garden is filled with chairs, and the chairs
      are filled by friends. In the autumn, and later when winter descends with
      its frosts, the chairs and the incumbent friends gather in a semicircle
      about the wide flame-filled crackling fireplaces. There be times when the
      wine passes; and the freighted mahogany sideboards discover that they have
      destinies beyond the ornamental.
    </p>
    <p>
      French politics bubbles and then boils; Paris is split by faction.
      Mirabeau controls the Assembly; Lafayette has the army under his hand&mdash;a
      weak, vacillating hand! These two are of the Moderates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones, coolly neutral in what sentiments go shaking the hour,
      has admirers in the parties. They come to him, and talk with him, and
      drink his wines in the shade of the back garden, or by the opulent
      fireplaces. Robespierre and Danton, as well as Mirabeau and Lafayette, are
      there. Also, Bertrand Barère, who boasts that he is not French but
      Iberian, one whose forbears came in with Hannibal. Later, Barère will
      preach an open-air sermon on the &ldquo;Life and Deeds of Admiral Paul Jones.&rdquo;
       Just now in the Assembly he makes ferocious speeches, garnished of savage
      expletives culled from the language of the Basques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warmest among friends of Admiral Paul Jones is the Thetford corset-maker
      Tom Paine, with his encarmined nose and love of freedom. Also Gouverneur
      Morris, who has succeeded Mr. Jefferson as America&rsquo;s Minister in France,
      comes often to the Rue Tournon. The pair are with him every day; and
      because all three like politics, and no two of them share the same views,
      dispute is deep. Aimee of the red-gold hair takes no part in these
      discussions, but sits watching her &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; with eyes of adoration,
      directing the servants, with a motion of the hand, to have a care that the
      debaters do not voice their beliefs over empty glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones, while a republican, gives his sympathies to the king,
      in whom there is much weakness, but no evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must not kill the king!&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; demands Tom Paine, whose bosom distills bitterness, and who
      holds there are no good kings save dead kings. &ldquo;Has France no Cromwell? We
      are both born Englishmen, Paul; our own people ere this have killed a
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; cries Admiral Paul Jones, heatedly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cromwell and England should not be cited as precedents here. King Louis
      is no Charles; and, as for Cromwell, there isn&rsquo;t the raw material in all
      France to make a Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gouverneur Morris says nothing, but sips his wine; remembering that, as
      the minister of a foreign nation, he should bear no part in French
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parisian rabble insult the king, and Lafayette, in command of the
      military about the Tuileries, sadly lacks decision. Then comes the &ldquo;Day of
      Daggers;&rdquo; the poor king, advised by the irresolute Lafayette, yields to
      the mob, and the assembled notables are disarmed. The anger of Admiral
      Paul Jones is extreme. He breaks forth to his friend Tom Paine:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to this time I&rsquo;ve been able to find reasons for the king&rsquo;s gentleness;
      but to-day&rsquo;s action was not gentle, it was weak. I pity the man&mdash;beset
      as he is by situations to which he is unequal. Lafayette cannot long
      restrain the sinister forces that confront him. He has neither the head
      nor the heart nor the hand for it. This is a time for grapeshot. I only
      wish that I might be in command of those thirty cannon parked about the
      palace, and have with me, even for a day, my old war-dogs of the <i>Ranger</i>
      and the <i>Richard</i>. Believe me, I should offer the mob convincing
      reasons in support of conservatism and justice; I should teach it
      forbearance at the muzzles of my guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the rabble might in its turn teach you,&rdquo; retorts Tom Paine, with a
      republican grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he exclaims, snapping contemptuous fingers. &ldquo;They of the mob are
      but sheep masquerading as tigers. One whiff of grapeshot, and they would
      disappear.&rdquo; Then he continues, thoughtfully: &ldquo;Their saddest trait is their
      levity. They are ridiculous even in their patriotism. Their emblems,
      representative of the grand sentiments they profess, are as childish as
      the language in which they proclaim them is fantastic. There is the red
      cap! Borrowed from the gutters, they make it the symbol of sovereignty! As
      though a ship were better for being keel up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mirabeau, with his lion&rsquo;s face, comes in. He is in a fury, and declares
      that Lafayette is a practising hypocrite in his pretences of attachment to
      the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hypocrisy!&rdquo; cries Mirabeau. &ldquo;That, at least, is a lesson in the school of
      liberty he never learned from Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others of the Moderates arrive, and join in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand, gentlemen,&rdquo; observes Admiral Paul Jones warmly,
      &ldquo;that I, in my time, have fought eight years for liberty. But I did not
      fight with the decrees of blood-mad Assemblies, or the plots of secret
      clubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those present smile tolerantly; for the mighty Paul is a person of many
      privileges, the one man in France who may speak his mind.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not deeply respect the Assembly?&rdquo; remarks Mirabeau, with a sour
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Assembly? What is it? A few who talk all the time, and a great many
      who applaud or hiss! Everything about it is theatrical. It struggles for
      epigram not principle, and the members would sooner say a smart thing than
      save France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paris is turmoil and uproar and tumult. To keep his mind from that strife
      which surrounds him, and into which he longs to plunge, Admiral Paul Jones
      puts in hours with his secretary, Benoît-André, dictating his journals.
      Also, business calls him to London, where he is much celebrated by the
      Whigs. He hobnobs with Fox and Sheridan, while Walpole carries him away to
      Strawberry Hill. He is with Walpole, when word arrives that Mirabeau is
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the effect in Paris&rsquo;?&rdquo; asks Walpole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be the effect! It will unchain the worst elements. The Assembly
      will now go to every red extreme. While Mirabeau lived, that strange
      concourse of evil spirits had a master. He is gone; the animals are
      without a keeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones returns to Paris, and finds a letter from Mr.
      Jefferson, now Secretary of State. Mr. Jefferson asks him to discover how
      far Europe will co-operate to crush out piracy in the Mediterranean. Also,
      he explains that President Washington will want the services of Admiral
      Paul Jones when he sends an expedition against the Barbary States.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he is reading Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s letter, a deputation from the Assembly
      waits on him, and sets forth informally that it is the present French
      purpose to reorganize the navy, and call him, Admiral Paul Jones, to the
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you accept?&rdquo; asks the deputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be, gentlemen,&rdquo; he returns, &ldquo;the part of prudence, and I think
      of modesty, to defer crossing that bridge till I come to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the deputation goes away, he calls Benoît-André, and sits long into
      the night dictating a treatise on reforming the French navy. He points out
      how its present inefficiency arises from the fact that, for centuries, it
      has been the feeding-ground of a voracious but incompetent aristocracy, a
      mere asylum for impoverished second sons, and other noble incapables. He
      sends a copy of his treatise to Walpole, who writes him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Admiral,&rdquo; says he of Strawberry Hill; &ldquo;let France go. Either
      return home to America and rest upon your laurels, or come over to
      England, where even those who do not love you admire you. You have fought
      under two flags; isn&rsquo;t that enough? I take your pamphlet to be simply a
      bid for a commission in the new French navy, and, because I love and
      admire you, I hope it will fail. It will be better so. Your laurels, won
      off Flamboro&rsquo; Head, will else be turned to cypress, when, as a French
      admiral, you become the target of British broadsides, with none of your
      stout Yankee tars to stand by and man your guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The winter is at an end; the grass of spring is starting. Admiral Paul
      Jones receives a letter from President Washington, who speaks of the
      Barbary States, and asks him to give up his commission in the Russian
      service. There have been two whose requests with him were ever final&mdash;Franklin
      and Washington. He does not hesitate, but forwards his resignation to
      Catherine. She will not accept, and puts forward old Suwarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not, my good brother,&rdquo; writes the old soldier&mdash;&ldquo;do not let any
      siren entice you from the service of the Empress. Your Frenchmen are
      preparing a stew of mischief that must soon keep all Western Europe busy
      to save themselves. That will be Russia&rsquo;s time. We shall then have a free
      hand with the Turk. Our command of the Black Sea is safe. Since you were
      there, we have built nine new ships of the line, and six stout frigates.
      You shall have them all. Also, I can now protect you from Court intrigues,
      which I could not do before. Courtiers, since Ismail, no longer trouble
      me; I brush them away like flies. In a new Turkish campaign, I would be
      Generalissimo by land and sea; you would be responsible to no one but me&mdash;a
      situation which, I flatter myself, would not be intolerable to you. Now,
      my good brother, the Empress has a copy of this letter, and agrees with
      all I say. Make no entanglements in the west; return to your old papa
      Suwarrow as soon as you can, and we shall discuss plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Suwarrow&rsquo;s missive fails of its hoped-for effect. Admiral Paul Jones
      gets out President Washington&rsquo;s letter and reads it again. Then he sends a
      polite but peremptory resignation to Catherine, and ends forever with the
      Russians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mon Paul,&rdquo; says Aimee, who looks over his shoulder, &ldquo;what a
      compliment! England, France, Russia, America&mdash;the whole world calls
      you! And the answer to all&rdquo;&mdash;here a kiss&mdash;&ldquo;is that you shall
      stay with your Aimee until she coaxes back your health.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>imee is right.
      Admiral Paul Jones, never his old sound self since that last cruise in the
      West Indies, is ill. Gourgaud says it is his lungs, and commands him to
      take care of himself. He obeys by sticking close to the red-gold Aimee,
      and the pleasant house in the Rue Tournon, with its fireplaces in the
      winter and its tree-shaded back garden in the summer&mdash;summer, when
      the hammock is swung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a stream of visitors pours in upon him. Even the poor king, in the
      midst of his troubles, sends to ask after the health of the &ldquo;Chevalier
      Jones.&rdquo; At odd hours, when visitors do not overrun him, he dictates his
      journals to Benoît-Andre, while Aimee gently swings his hammock with her
      white hand.

      <a href="images/0319.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It is a hazy July day; the drone of pillaging bees, busy among the
      flowers, fills the back garden in the Rue Tournon. It is one of Admiral
      Paul Jones&rsquo; &ldquo;good days;&rdquo; a-swing in his hammock, he chats with Major
      Beaupoil about a recent dinner at which he was the guest of Jacobin honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at the Cafe Timon,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a favorite rendezvous of the
      Jacobins. Believe me, Major, while I cannot speak in highest terms of the
      Jacobins, I can of the Cafe Timon. One day I hope to take you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gouverneur Morris is announced. He tells Admiral Paul Jones of advices
      from Mr. Jefferson, and that Mr. Pinckney has been selected Minister to
      St. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, to my mind,&rdquo; concludes Mr. Morris, &ldquo;is of most consequence, Mr.
      Pinckney bears with him from President Washington your commission as an
      Admiral in the American navy. You are to be ready, you note, to sail
      against those Barbary robbers when the squadron arrives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not alone be ready,&rdquo; he returns, &ldquo;I shall be delighted.&rdquo; He
      springs from the hammock, and takes a quick turn up and down the garden.
      The prospect of a brush with the swarthy freebooters of the Mediterranean
      animates him mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other visitors are announced. Barère, Lafayette, Carnot, Cambon,
      Vergniaud, Marron, Collot, Billaud, Kersaint, Gensonne, Barbaroux and
      Louvet one after the other arrive. Laughter and jest and conversation
      become the order of the afternoon; for all are glad, and argue, from his
      high spirits, the soon return to health of Admiral Paul Jones. There has
      been no more cheerful hour in the Rue Tournon back garden. Corks are drawn
      and glasses clink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk leaves politics for religion. &ldquo;My church,&rdquo; observes Admiral Paul
      Jones&mdash;&ldquo;my church has been the ocean, my preacher the North Star, my
      choir the winds singing in the ship&rsquo;s rigging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your faith?&rdquo; asks Major Beaupoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may find it, my dear Major, in Pope&rsquo;s Universal Prayer:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;Teach me to feel another&rsquo;s woe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To hide the faults I see;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That mercy I to others show,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Such mercy show to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;I call that stanza a complete boxing of the
      religious compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gourgaud looks in professionally, and is inclined to take a solemn view of
      his patient&rsquo;s health. He rebukes him for running about the garden among
      his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not have permitted it,&rdquo; says Gourgaud, admonishing Aimee with
      upraised finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he refused to be restrained!&rdquo; returns Aimee, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gourgaud!&rdquo; the patient breaks forth cheerily, &ldquo;you know the aphorism: At
      forty every man is either a fool or a doctor. Now I am over forty; and, as
      a fellow-practitioner, I promise you that our patient, Paul Jones, is out
      of danger and on the mend.&rdquo; Then, gayly: &ldquo;Come, Gourgaud, don&rsquo;t croak!
      Take a glass of wine, man; you frighten Aimee with your long looks.&rdquo;
       Gourgaud takes his wine; but his looks are quite as long as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly and apropos of nothing, Admiral Paul Jones decides to make his
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your will!&rdquo; protests Gouverneur Morris, somewhat aghast. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t
      been in such health for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on account of my health,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;but because of those Barbary
      pirates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notaries are brought in by Benoît-André, and the will is drawn. The
      gallant testator is for giving all to his Aimee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house you already have,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and also an annuity. Now I leave
      you the rest; and Beaupoil shall be executor, with Morris as a witness.
      There; it is arranged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it is not arranged. The red-gold Aimee points out that he has certain
      nieces and nephews in Scotland and Virginia; they must not be forgotten.
      He yields to amendments in behalf of those nieces and nephews. Then the
      will is sealed and signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has eased my mind,&rdquo; he says, giving the document into the hands of
      Major Beaupoil for safe-keeping&mdash;&ldquo;it has eased my mind more than I
      supposed possible.&rdquo; Then, with a look at Aimee: &ldquo;There will be enough, <i>petite</i>,
      to take care of you, even though our friends here turn the country
      bottom-side up. Luckily, too, the property is in England and America and
      Holland, where values stand more steadily than they do in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aimee remembers the &ldquo;Sword of Honor,&rdquo; given by King Louis for that victory
      over the <i>Serapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always declared it should go to your friend, Dale,&rdquo; she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aimee brings the sword. She presses the gilt scabbard to her lips; then
      she puts it in the hands of her &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo; He half draws the blade, and
      considers it with an eye of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see this sword?&rdquo; he remarks to Gouverneur Morris, &ldquo;Should I die,
      carry it with my love to Dick Dale&mdash;my good old Dick, who did more
      than any other man to help me win it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is nine o&rsquo;clock; night has fallen. The many friends have gone their
      homeward ways. The back parlor of the house in the Rue Tournon is peaceful
      and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Paul Jones sits in his cushioned easy-chair reading a volume of
      Voltaire. Now and then he addresses to Aimee some comment of agreement or
      disagreement with his lively author. Aimee offers no counter comments, but
      smiles accord to everything; for her heart is lighter and her bosom more
      tranquil than for many a day, as she basks in the sunshine of new hopes
      for the restoration of her &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some duty of the house calls Aimee. She leaves her Paul the lamplight
      shining on the pages of the book, his loved face in the shadow. She pauses
      at the door, her deep, soft eyes full of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aimee is on the stair returning. An ominous sound reaches her ears! Her
      heart grows cold; alarm seizes her by the throat, as though a hand
      clutched her! She knows by some instinct that the end has come, and her
      &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; lies dead or dying! She can neither move nor cry out!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she regains command of herself. With quaking limbs she mounts
      the stair. The door of the back drawing-room stands open. The lamp still
      burns, but its radiance no longer lights the pages of the philosopher of
      Fernay. They fall across the motionless body of her &ldquo;Paul.&rdquo; He lies with
      head and shoulder resting on a couch, which he was trying to reach when
      stricken down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aimee gazes for one horror-frozen moment. Then, with a wailing sob, as
      from the depths of her soul, she throws her arms about him. She covers the
      marble lips with kisses&mdash;those dauntless, defiant lips!&mdash;while
      her thick hair, breaking from its combs, hides, as with a veil of red and
      gold, the loved face from the prying lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon is reading those gloomy despatches which tell of Trafalgar.
      Crushing the paper in his hand, he paces the floor, his pale, moody face
      swept by gusty emotions of pain and anger and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berthier, how old was Paul Jones when he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty-five, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There comes a gloom-filled silence; the gray, brooding eyes seek the floor
      in thought. Then the pacing to and fro is resumed, that hateful despatch
      still clutched fast in the nervous fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berthier: Paul Jones did not fulfil his destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
